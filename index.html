        <h1>Who and What is The Duck Pond DND?</h1>
        <p>
            I am James, a 31 year old content creator from the United Kingdom, and the Head Duck at the Duck Pond.
            The Duck Pond has existed as a community since February 2021 when I first started streaming on Twitch, but
            soon progressed
            into a wonderful Dungeons and Dragons community that thrives today.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here at the Duck Pond Website, we hope to provide a central point of access for all sorts of information
            relating to Dungeons and Dragons.
            Whether it is how to best optimize your very own Dungeons and Dragons character, different methods of
            rolling stats, specific information relating
            to a fantasy world setting, be it an Official world or a world within a Duck Pond Homebrew Campaign or much
            else besides.
        </p>
        <p>

            to our community, regadless of their background or experience
            with Dungeons and Dragons, but we do operate a strictly 18+ rule for all of our community. We hope that you
