        <h1 class="world-page-title">Playable Races in Xandros</h1>
        <p>In the interest of a more diverse world, and due to the collapsing of the boundaries between realms, there
            are many races in the world that may be unfamiliar to players and others that are different in this world to
            others. Each of these races have their own restrictions and specific origins, and many of them will require
            care to play and will change the dynamic of the game. I would suggest in depth discussion with the group and
            the DM before choosing some of these. It is worth noting that these races are in addition to the available
            races provided by published content. Information on the already published races within Xandros may be
            provided at a later date.
        </p>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Aaba</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Aabas have very distinct features that obviously single them out as being much different than just
                another common humanoid. Atop their heads are two antennas that are used for searching for food,
                communication between other abba, and can even enhance hearing. Their legs are the most prominent
                differences between other common races, for their legs are that of massive grasshoppers that are capable
                of carrying an Abba up to 10 times its height. Landing is not an issue because their legs easily
                retract, acting like shocks to keep them upright.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aaba skin ranges from forest green to a very dark brown. Female Aaba tend to be darker in shade than
                Males, but it can vary. Most Aaba have a pair of translucent wings that provide the gift of flight.
                However, many are unable to use them because of their curse. There are two types of Aabas, the
                Speedwings and the Chakraabas, the Speedwings are more martial in appearance and personality, the
                Chakraabas more magical. The Aaba found much common ground with the Thri-Kreen, and upon the discovery
                of a small pocket of Elysium surrounded by a deadly mushroom grove, the insectoid species worked
                together to build Kreegaa.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Aefling</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Aeflings are a mixture between aasimar and tiefling blood, which before the Sundering was nothing short
                of unforgivable, and the product of that is simply irredeemable. These days Aeflings still face their
                trials and disparagement, but far less than one might expect. Often this mixture of blood results in
                creatures with erratic personalities, wildly swinging emotions and a dangerous level of impulsiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are not many Aeflings in the world, but those that do exist tend towards the shadier areas of big
                cities. Despite their incredible beauty, Aeflings find it difficult to be consistent or reliable, often
                leaving them shunned and discriminated against.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Abomination</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Abominations are humanoids that have been subjected to a harrowing experience and have been forever
                changed. They may hide among society in their humanoid form, but a monster lives within the abomination,
                able to transform into an unrivalled predator. No two are alike, save for the unrelenting hunger that
                lurks within, urging them to violence. Some embrace it, others rail against the bloody cravings, but all
                suffer from its burden.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those that have renounced their thirst for blood and hunter’s instincts to instead seek peace with
                others have mostly been accepted into the Lycan communities within Lunethra. Those that relish in their
                blood thirst are often found on the fringes of society, committing foul deeds and revelling in them.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Android</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Built as mindless (not counting their AI) automations for labour, service, and soldiers; the androids
                developed sentience from a side effect of magical feedback merging with their AI creating a new kind of
                creature. As mortal-made constructs, many think they are little more than property; however, others have
                noted their ability to develop individual personalities and thoughts as something completely separate
                from other constructs, making the androids no different from the living races. Androids themselves have
                varying opinions on the matter of their being.
            </p>
            <p>
                Androids originated in Mechania, where Rock Gnomes and Mountain Dwarves worked together to create
                automated creatures with small levels of Artificial Intelligence to do menial tasks due to the lack of
                population within the city. Since the creation of the first Androids, science has come a long way, and
                many different cities create Androids for tasks both menial and trivial. The upper nobility often use
                Androids as butlers for example. Artificial Intelligence has developed greatly over recent years
                however, and due to the feedback of magic merging with this AI, Androids are very much their own beings
                now. Androids can be found in almost every city throughout the world of Xandros, with the only
                exceptions being Lunethra and Kreegaa where they are far less common.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Animated Armor</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Animated armors are full sets of armor that can move and speak on their own, their various pieces of
                plating seemingly unburdened by gravity. While they have no physical presence inside them, they function
                just like a person in a full suit of armor. They can be moulded or cast to fit a certain race, being
                anything from small enough to comfortably fit a gnome to large enough to completely cover an orc. Their
                weight and size, as well as their design and material, are up to their creator. While metal is most
                often used, anarmors composed entirely of stone or animal skins are not uncommon. Magic is often used to
                bring the armor to life and keep it from falling apart. Whilst at first they tend to have little
                personality beyond their purpose, over time they can develop sentience and individual personalities as a
                result of the feedback of magic. Animated Armors are only found in the Enclave and surrounding areas as
                Golem Defenders to the Enclave.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Awakened Undead</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Most cultures fear death. The sight of the undead is one that brings revulsion, terror and rebuke. While
                there are many ways one might slip out of the bony clutches of death, a return to life rarely means a
                return to the life once lived. There are many barriers beyond the fears of mortals; the awakened undead
                can find themselves far from their homeland, or in a time where the life they knew, even their homeland,
                no longer exists. The awakened undead feel this separation palpably. This is why most undead are rarely
                seen in the company of the living. When the awakened undead choose to interact with the living, or try
                to make a life within the borders of civilization, they will often go to great lengths to hide or
                disguise their true nature. Fragrant perfumes or pungent ointments are used to mask their decaying
                odours, and they will hide their corpses in heavy cloaks and hoods of cloth or illusion. In Morena,
                however, the Awakened Undead are a common sight, and are the majority of the populace.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Corpse Orchid</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Corpse Orchids are plants that have gained sentience and intelligence through the Sundering that often
                spend their entire lives in one place, unable to move their host bodies in a proper capacity. When an
                orchid manages to inhabit a body without too much damage, they have an irresistible urge to move, to
                live amongst other races and to propagate their seed in new areas of the world. This dark nature leads
                to a deep distrust from living races, though many corpse orchids tend to cemeteries on behalf of small
                remote communities.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Dhampir (Vampire)</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Tall and slender and with well-defined musculature, dhampirs look like statuesque humans of unearthly
                beauty. Their hair, eye, and skin colours resemble unnerving versions of their mothers’; many possess a
                ghastly pallor, particularly in the sunlight, while those with dark complexions often possess skin the
                colour of a bruise. While many dhampirs can pass as humans in ideal conditions, their features are
                inevitably more pronounced and they move with an unnaturally fluid grace. All dhampirs have elongated
                incisors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most Dhampir live in the City of Evernight, where they do not have to worry about stray rays of
                sunlight, and instead can focus on the true joy of most vampires; politics. The games of intrigue and
                secrecy that are engaged in within the borders of the City of Evernight would leave most mortals
                astounded. There are nuances, traditions and mannerisms specific to the city and its various castes that
                would take years of study for an outsider to understand. Most of the Dhampir within the City of
                Evernight live on animal blood or donations from the mortal populace, and very few kill their victims.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Doppelganger</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Doppelgangers are wily shapeshifters that can take on the forms of other humanoids and glean the very
                thoughts from inside their minds. Experts in subterfuge and deceit, they can impersonate almost anyone
                with ease. These creatures have spread through almost every land, living on stolen wealth and pulling
                off schemes that make even master tricksters bristle with envy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although not particularly common, they are far more common since the clashing of the planes, as there
                was a large population of them within Limbo. Doppelgangers tend to make their careers from the shadier
                parts of cities where they can sell their dark arts as services.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Dryad</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Once beings who made their homes within the forests and trees of the land, these days Dryads have taken
                the spirit of their trees into themselves. Growing much like trees do, but with the spirit of a woman
                inside, dryads resemble the most dazzling of female elves, but with natural foliage growing from within
                their skin. Most Dryads wander the Wilderness seeking a return to their natural state of sharing their
                lives symbiotically with trees planted within the ground, but few find anywhere to place their roots
                safely.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Fallen Deity</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>When the Sundering struck, most Gods were reduced to mortality. Remembering little before the Sundering
                other than their nature and origins, but blessed with perfect recall and unusual powers. Each fallen
                deity manifested in a different way, a different body, but all retained the eyes of one who was timeless
                and from a higher place.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Flumph</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Flumphs communicate telepathically. Though they resemble jellyfish, flumphs are sentient beings of great
                intelligence and wisdom, possessing advanced knowledge of religion, philosophy, mathematics, and
                countless other subjects. Flumphs are sensitive to the emotional states of nearby creatures. If a
                creature's thoughts suggest goodness, a flumph seeks that creature out. When facing creatures that exude
                evil, a flumph flees.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most Flumphs are found around the cities of Laketon and Academia feeding on the psionic energies of the
                Aboleth and Mind Flayers alike. They are a gentle folk who tend to guide travellers on their ways in and
                out of the cities and are welcomed by the hosts of those cities as warnings of invasion from evil
                outsiders.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Gnoll</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Whether firmly under Yeenoghu’s influence or making their living in a less violent society, gnolls can be
                best described as aggressive, furry powerhouses. They can range anywhere from aggressively friendly,
                aggressively dogmatic, aggressively unimpressed, and just about any state of being you can stick
                ‘aggressive’ in front of.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most Gnolls are found as guards for the city of Va’lsharah, under Drow leadership. Some, however, find
                their ways to the Scavenger Towns in the Wilderness and make their lives there independently.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Inkling</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Inklings are an amphibious race. They spend most of their time frolicking around the waters of Laketon,
                enjoying the beauty and bounty of the water. Other races may think them frivolous, but inklings know the
                value of a good time. Under the surface (literally and figuratively) inklings understand the depth and
                power of the water, and often do their best to emulate it.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Lycanthrope</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>One of the most ancient and feared of all curses, lycanthropy can transform the most civilised humanoid
                into a ravening beast. In its natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its
                normal self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire features suggestive of their animal form. In
                that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection,
                its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most Lycans are found within the city of Lunethra, where they spend the majority of their time living
                with few outsiders, focusing their energies on returning Selune to power and thriving within their city
                despite the lack of technology within its walls. The Lycans also travel to other Cities, often as
                mercenaries and guards due to their ferocious capabilities in battle.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Mind Flayer</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Mind flayers are vastly intelligent beings, otherwise known as illithids. During the Sundering, many of
                the slaves they kept were eradicated, leaving the Mind Flayer hives strangely vulnerable. To protect the
                central brain, and to develop and survive, the hive ascertained that their best course of action was to
                study the Arts Arcane and to build themselves a city. To this end, many Mind Flayers became Arcane
                Polymaths, and used Arcane Magic to build Academia, a city of towers in which the Great Brain is kept.
                Mind Flayers no longer keep slaves, but instead trade their knowledge for the manual labour of others.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Minotaur</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Since the Sundering, Minotaurs have tended far more often towards trade and peace than towards violence.
                Still, they are often guards and mercenaries, being naturally inclined towards the warriors’ arts.
                Minotaurs are very diverse in nature, some bearing large horns like a bull and some none at all. Most
                minotaurs revel in jewellery and treasure and have a primal desire to collect beauty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Minotaurs are most often found in Scavenger Cities as independent mercenaries or within the larger
                cities of Arrenus and Newton. It should be mentioned, however, that there is a unit of the Laketon army
                consisting solely of Minotaurs trained in the arts of combat with guns.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Shadar-Kai</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Shadar-Kai were once the inhabitants of the Shadowfell, followers of the Raven Queen. Since the
                Sundering, they have lived passionately and fearlessly, enjoying the severing of their ties to the
                Shadow Realm and the freedom they now have. Despite this, many Shadar-Kai are still naturally at home
                within the Shadows and the darker parts of Xandros. Some Shadar-Kai continually seek the Raven Queen,
                determined to see her rise again. These Shadar-Kai have made pacts to achieve this goal, and are
                distinctive by the raven crest they wear, and the scythe-like weapons they wield.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Thri-Kreen</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>When the Thri-Kreen arrived on Xandros after the Sundering, they could not communicate with anyone. Far
                from their desert-like homelands, they had to adapt vastly to survive. Although much of this was
                learning to trade and interact with the locals, the importance of the arrival of the Aaba, and the
                closeness of these two species, cannot be underestimated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thri-kreen resemble bipedal praying mantises. Their bodies are coated in exoskeletons with various
                earthy hues, including rust red, sandy yellow, and mottled green-brown. Unlike most humanoids,
                thri-kreen possess six limbs, walking on two legs and possessing four arms, each ending in four
                prehensile, claw-like fingers. The lower two arms are smaller and less-powerful than the upper two.
                Their heads possess compound eyes, generally in somewhat-brighter colours like green or blue, antennae,
                and mandibles. Because of the alien shape of their jaws, they have difficulty speaking and pronouncing
                Common and most other humanoid languages besides their own.

        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Custom Lineage</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>There are many other races within the lands of Xandros, some limited to only a couple of members of that
                race still struggling for survival after the Sundering. If you have an idea for a race within Xandros,
                likelihood is that members of that race can be found. Let your DM know if there’s a race you’d like to
                play and build it within the Custom Lineage rules together.
