        <h1 class="world-page-title">Culture in Xandros</h1>
        <p>
            For the most part, cultures are very separated by city. It is very worth knowing however, that there are
            very few races that are segregated or shunned within the world. Whilst some people may find that which a
            doppelganger does a little distasteful, or the origins of the Abominations, Werewolves and Vampires a little
            frightening, they are regarded as normal citizens.
        </p>
        <p>
            Further to this, races that in some games may be viewed as “evil” or “good” are very unusual in the world of
            Xandros. The best of people did what they had to for survival during the Sundering, and many who were once
            dark of heart turned to companionship, brotherhood and civilization for protection. There are no races
            regarded as innately evil within the cities and even some monsters are regarded well for their abilities if
            they are willing to hold a truce. It is said that there is even trade with Devils, Demons and Aberrations in
            some places.

            It should also be noted that whilst worship of the Gods is still present, it is not as central to daily life
            as it once was for many cultures. The Lycans and the Drow are still fairly ardent worshippers, but their
            Gods have mellowed during the Sundering. For the most part, many Gods are observed, and rare is the God that
            is only looked to by a single race. Even Lolth counts many Gnoll, Minotaurs, Kobolds and Tieflings amongst
            her congregations. There are also many Gods who chose not to reascend to the pantheons and instead wander
            the earth; powerful, but no more so than strong sorcerers, dragons or giants. Some of these have accrued
            cult followings, but usually they are regarded as powerful singular citizens.
