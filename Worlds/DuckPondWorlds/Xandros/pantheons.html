        <p>
            At the time of the Sundering, many Gods were lost forever. Some were reduced to Mortal form, some lost in
            the transition of realms, and some simply disappeared. The few that managed to retain godhood at the time of
            the Sundering were Ao, who is said to have sheltered Xandros and allowed the continuation of existence
            itself, Mystra, Oghma and Lolth. A few other Gods swiftly returned to their positions in the Pantheon,
            including Moradin, Corellon, Mask, Mielikki and Chauntea but most other Gods have either died out or remain
            in mortal form.
        </p>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Ao</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>
                Once known as the Overgod, or the Watcher, when the Sundering happened, it was Ao that sheltered the
                world between his wings and gathered the planes within his hands, shaping the existence we have today.
                It is said that this act drained much of his Godly power, and although many worship him, and even the
                other Gods speak of him in hushed tones, he never replies. It is thought he may have died in the
                creation of the current universe.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Mystra</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>
                One of the few to survive the Sundering, Mystra protected the Weave, allowing magic to remain and to
                flourish in the new world. The Weave is more accessible than it once was, but the highest powers of the
                weave are fractured and weakened, meaning that ascending to Godhood is much more difficult, and
                creatures that were once regarded as Demigods are now nothing but mortals. Few worship Mystra directly,
                but the prevalence of magic users in the current world gives her power nearly unrivalled within the
                Pantheon of the Gods.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Oghma</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>
                Oghma, God of Learning and Knowledge, also survived the Sundering, and helped many learn of the new
                world. During the Age of Technology, indirect worship of Oghma has elevated him to one of the most
                powerful of deities within the Pantheon. Few worship Oghma directly, instead preferring gentler Gods,
                but with research and learning so important in the era of technology, his power is unlikely to wane.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Lolth</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>
                With the induction of the Forbidden into her ever-expanding congregation, as well as the endless loyalty
                of her many drow followers, Lolth remains a powerful and fearful member of the Pantheon. The Sundering
                weakened many other Gods, but it is said that the closing of the realms brought her various clergies
                closer together.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Moradin</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>
                With the induction of the Gnomes of Mechania into his congregation, and his swift elevation back into
                the Pantheon of the Gods, Moradin holds a strong place in the heart of all Dwarves and Gnomes. Many
                others who are craftsmen and tradesmen worship Moradin directly and give thanks to him for his bountiful
                knowledge and resources.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Corellon</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>
                Father of the Elves, Corellon fell briefly during the Sundering, but swiftly rose to power again as now
                the only God of the Elves. All the Elves except the Drow give worship to him directly, and call upon the
                Father to preserve them. Corellon is an arrogant but benevolent God, and he shelters the Elves above
                all.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Mask</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>
                Many Gods lost their powers during the Sundering, but few gained more than Mask. A patron of thieves,
                scavengers and those that stop at nothing to survive, the Sundering was a time of vast power for Mask.
                Even today, the Scavenger Cities give service to him directly, as do many of the shadier folk in the big
                cities. Mask, it would seem, is a power that will stand strong for a long, long time.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Mielikki</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>
                Goddess of Nature and forests, rangers and druids, it might be expected that in the near-extermination
                of Nature, Meilikki would fall. Quite the opposite, members of all clergies and races turned to Nature
                in the hope that she would once again provide for them as she once did. Meilikki was one of the first to
                return to the Pantheon, and many beseech her for bounty directly within all the cities.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Chauntea</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>
                After the fall of Lathander, Chauntea was turned to by many who hoped for preservation and life, as well
                as many who struggled for food and nourishment. The Earthmother retained her place in the Pantheon when
                the Sundering came, and seeks to return the world to a place of autumnal bounty and agriculture.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Other Gods</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>
                Many Gods who have fallen, or who have turned to the Mortal life are still prayed to and worshipped.
                Perhaps the most notable of these is Selune, whom the Lycans regularly pray to and hope to restore to
                her full power, though many others are called upon in strange parts of the world. Others, still, hope to
                take the step up to divinity in the place of those that have fallen, and seek ascension from their
                mortal coils.
