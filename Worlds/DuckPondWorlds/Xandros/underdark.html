        <h1 class="world-page-title">The Underdark</h1>
        <p>
            The Underdark is where the most interphasing of other realms and planes has appeared, and some of the
            strangest twists of landscape occur. Within the depths beneath the surfaces of the world is where you can
            encounter bottomless lakes, pits filled with elements of the nine hells, impossible dungeons that ascend and
            descend with no rhyme or rule. There is still the magic of the Faerzress beneath the crust of the earth, but
            it is now twisted by the various different planes that intersect with its winding halls.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the cities harness the Underdarkâ€™s unusual magics to power the city above; cities such as Mechania
            and Arrenus use the Underdark for farming, whereas Lazros and Newton use the powerful magics to power their
            factories and industry. There are many dungeons, ruins and caves that intersect with the larger Underdark,
            and these can be far more dangerous to delve into. The Underdark no longer carries on uninterrupted
            throughout the world, instead being blocked off at various points by different planes of existence and
            landscape changes, this means many a race that used to keep solely to the Underdark are now living in cities
            above the ground, primary examples of this are the Deep Gnomes, Drow and Mind Flayers.
