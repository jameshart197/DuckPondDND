        <h1 class="world-page-title">Guilds and Factions in Xandros</h1>
        <p>
            There are countless factions and guilds throughout the world of Xandros who hold power in their own ways.
            Some hold power only within the city they exist in and some
            spread their power throughout the entire world. Either way, wherever you go in Xandros you will inevitably
            meet some members of the factions listed below.
        </p>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Coven of Shared Truth</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>A Coven of Witches exists within the forests surrounding the Enclave. This Coven are dedicated to the
                sharing of knowledge of the Old World to benefit the new one. The hatred between the Coven of Shared
                Truth and the Enclave is well documented and wholly mutual. Specialising in the old arts of arcane
                ritual casting and the brewing of magical intoxicants and potions, their magic is a call back to the
                time before the Sundering, when technology did not exist. Nevertheless, the Coven make excellent use of
                technology and do not eschew it whatsoever, instead encouraging its use to create a world of harmony
                where all manners of survival are admired and taught. Members of the Coven are often sent out to various
                cities and towns to learn what they can and bring the knowledge back to the Coven to be shared amongst
                its’ members.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">The Enclave</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Archivists, Order of the Scribes Wizards, Knowledge Clerics and Shepherd Druids protect specimens of
                every form of nature. One of each of these is the head of their Order within the Enclave, and these 4
                are known as Keepers. Nobody knows how many Keepers there are at any given time, and the knowledge of
                these people is strictly secret. Their longest term goal will be restoring the world to how it once was.
                Their biggest rivals are the Coven of Shared Truth who are a Coven of Witches who believe all the
                knowledge within the walls of the Enclave should be shared immediately for the benefit of all, and the
                hatred between these two groups is mutual.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Order of the Vampire</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>The Order are the elite guards of the city of Evernight. Mostly composed of predator races such as Leonin
                and Aarakocra, these already strong mortals take on a level of immortality by embracing the vampiric
                gifts and transferring vampiric blood into their own bodies through dark rituals. These Nightwalkers are
                dedicated and vicious warriors.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Githyanki Battlemages</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Githyanki had spent several centuries living in luxury and training on the Astral Plane prior to the
                Sundering. When the Sundering struck, a small band of these battlemages fell through the cracks between
                the planes and found themselves within a small clearing. Met by some elves, with powerful magic of their
                own, a friendship was formed that has lasted since. The Githyanki guard the Enclave, leading the
                animated armours and training them.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Sorcerer's Syndicate</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>These are a powerful group of sorcerers that have made their headquarters in the city of Newton though
                they have outposts in some other cities. The Sorcerer’s Syndicate draws their magic from the Shadowfell;
                though little of it still remains. The primary aims of the Syndicate are manifesting power from the
                elements of the Shadowfell that still exist, preserving the pockets of Shadowfell that are within the
                material plane, and trying to secure all the political power they can manage. Their leader is an old
                Shadar-kai by the name of Nadarian, he is an ancient and powerful man who is ruthless in his political
                aspirations.
            </p>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">The Battleaxe Brigade</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>The Battleaxe Brigade is the rapid response unit of Mechania. Although part of the regular guard, they
                are well-known for their disregard of tactics and order in favour of a more direct approach. This is
                embodied most by their current leader, Rotharus Thump, who has survived no fewer than 612 encounters
                with monsters and beasts so far. He usually achieves this by taking on a level of savagery beyond that
                of the beasts themselves. It is said that he trains his warriors by asking them to break through small
                stone walls with their heads. Bravery and stupidity compete for priority within this brigade.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">The Gnommish Conglomerate of Airship Constructors</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Led by a consortium of well-respected artificers and inventors, the Gnomes are quick to remind everyone
                that it was they who first put airships in the sky. Since then, airship construction has come a
                tremendous way, leading to the luxurious, swift and resilient crafts of today. The Conglomerate are very
                open to advising and inspecting the handiwork of other races, though they will always be swift to point
                out inferiority. Based in Mechania, they also operate out of Arennus and Newton, and all airships,
                whether gnommish or not, must pass their inspection before being permitted to take passengers on the
                airways.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Rival Airship Builders</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Groups of rival airship builders include Mech Inc., the Newton Foundation, the Drow Artisans of
                Va’lsharah and the Lazros Mages. Mech Inc. in Arennus is a group of humans with strong magic, a desire
                to learn, and great respect for the Conglomerate. The Newton Foundation are extremely ambitious and have
                no qualms about using stolen knowledge to fuel their ambitions. They aim to become one of the dominant
                manufacturers of airships through mass production of standardised models. To this end, they have
                recruited various automatons who have previously worked with the gnomes. The Drow Artisans are
                exceptionally magically gifted, but have a lot to learn with regards to artifice. They study
                relentlessly, however, and have worked closely with the gnomes to improve their craft. The Lazros Mages
                continue their stubborn attempts to create airships with magic alone, completely disregarding all
                scientific craft. Although their airships fly swiftly, they are unstable, dangerous, and generally
                unreliable.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Gunsmiths</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>For the most part, individual cities each have their own gunsmiths. Whilst in most cities you can find a
                small group of smiths who will create guns for the armies and guards of the cities, these workers tend
                to be independent, and quality of craftsmanship can vary greatly from city to city. However, in Newton,
                the Broding Armory has begun to create standardised models of simple pistols and hunting rifles which
                are made with less expensive materials to a mould, resulting in exceptionally cheap and quick
                production. Thus far, they have only sold their weapons to the Newton Government, though rumours say
                they are looking to enter the commercial arena.

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Pilot Licensing Corporation</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>The Pilot Licencing Corporation is a simple group of Storm Sorcerers, Air Druids and Oath of the Storms
                Paladins who have flown in the past. They assess new pilots for their capabilities, understanding and
                control before they are allowed to Captain a ship or fly commercial or passenger vehicles. The tests are
                fairly simple, but complex for anyone without the correct skills. It should be noted that navigation is
                not a required skill for new pilots, being a task that can easily be delegated.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Blue Mages</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>When the Bastion upon Lazros was built, there was a group of monks from a nearby monastery that trained
                relentlessly to mimic the arts of monsters and beasts to enhance their abilities. When the Bastion was
                threatened, these monks used their training and combined with the mages from the monastery in an attempt
                to defend the populace. The art of the Blue Mage was born in Lazros, and to this day there are very few
                who study its traditions from outside the city. Entrance to the Monastery of the Blue Mages is
                incredibly exclusive, and just entering the Monastery as an Acolyte by no means guarantees graduation.
                Most Blue Mages are Shifters.

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Most Honourable League of Treasure Hunters</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>
                The Most Honourable League of Treasure Hunters are those few treasure hunters that have survived long
                enough to grow too old to practice their craft. For the most part they protect the rights against
                taxation that have been given to Treasure Hunters who enter the Wilderness and risk their lives to
                discover relics of old. They also protect “First Rights” which says that no government may lay claim to
                relics from the Wilderness before the Treasure Hunter decides where such treasures are delegated. The
                League also protects the maps of already discovered and explored ruins, caves and tombs, making them
                public access to all members of the League.

        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Archaelogists Society</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>The Archaeologists Society are based within Laketon, and command little respect from anyone worth
                mentioning. They have attempted to secure rights to maps that are drawn of certain areas that they claim
                are “important” or “pertain to aspects of pre-Sundering History”, though most believe that they are
                simply looking to recruit Treasure Rats for their own purposes instead of going through the proper
                channels. This group of Tortles, Tritons and Grung are mostly a hypothetical faction, as they do not
                command any power, nor do anything of much use. Nevertheless, they gather and discuss areas of history
                and interest, and occasionally one of the richer members may pay a group of Treasure Hunters to explore
                those areas. They have come into possession, mostly through their own wealth, of a fair number of maps
                of the Wilderness however.

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">The Arcane Association of Meteorologists</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>The Arcane Association of Meteorologists are based within Lazros. They are the foremost experts on the
                unusual weather patterns within Xandros, and especially within the areas of the Wilderness where weather
                changes so swiftly it cannot be predicted. They have spent many decades trying to find ways to prevent
                the falling of acid rain, to protect cities from the ashfalls and to accurately predict the blizzards
                that can be deadly to anyone caught unawares. Despite their being based in Lazros, these Weather Wizards
                are funded by cities all over the world, with members coming from every different walk of life to assist
                them however they can.
