        <p>
            Various members of the Most Honourable League of Treasure Hunters make their homes throughout the world.
            Some of them operate from big cities, some from the small scavenger townships in the Wilderness. These brave
            and reckless adventurers do have one thing in common though; their passion for the relics of older times,
            and exploration of the vastly untouched Wilderness.
        </p>

            Maps leading to treasure, often made from above the ground by passing airships, or through rumours and
            translations of maps that pre-date the Sundering, are incredibly valuable and sought after items. Some
            treasure rats prefer the overland ruins and remnants of cities and towns, some prefer the old halls of
            dwarven mountain kings and drow settlements, whilst others seek the crypts and tombs of old.

            Fewer are the treasure hunters that seek new-world treasures; Pockets of planes, caves, halls and castles
            that arrived with the Sundering from realms afar, these places are dangerous primarily because they often
            arrived with their occupants. Those who hunt these types of treasure often live short lives, but gather
            wealth extremely quickly in those lives. A risky pastime.
        </p>
        <p>
            It should be noted that in these places of treasure delving it is customary to make camp outside the ruin,
            castle or cave and use that as a home base, delving into the ruins from outside. It can be most difficult to
            manage even the shortest of respites in these ruins riddled with danger and mystery.
        </p>

            During the course of a dungeon, a long rest may be had at the beginning of the dungeon, and the group can
            leave to take one again, though occupants within the dungeon may be aware of intruders and seek to sabotage
            you upon your return to the dungeon. Short rests can be achieved in certain “safe spots” or at the end of
            dungeon levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many treasures in the world, and they are not only worth seeking for their monetary value; Whether
            it is artifacts of strength, battle-enhancing magics, luxury inducing inventions or strange grimoires - be
            it ancient art, unusual resources, sources of strange knowledge or contraptions of otherworldly nature,
            treasure can be used or sold, and that is often a complex and difficult decision.
        </p>
        <p>
            When attaining maps pointing towards treasures there is often little known about the dangers lurking within
            these ruins, caves and ancient halls. Sellers and providers of these maps may be able to provide some
            information regarding these places, and a vague estimate of the strength of its occupants but the expert on
            these matters is widely thought to be Gallahan; Aarakocra Scout and old Treasure Rat. He resides within a
            mansion in upper Arrenus, and will tell you what he knows and can ascertain for a small fee.
