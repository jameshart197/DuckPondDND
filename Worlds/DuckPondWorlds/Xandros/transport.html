        <h2>Airship</h2>
        <p>
            The most common form of travel in the Wilderness is by Airship, though they are expensive to build and
            complex to pilot. Building an Airship requires knowledge of the art of Magnetic Plating, which absorbs power
            from the unnatural weathers of Xandros and channels it into a ring that propels the Airship. Piloting an
            Airship requires the ability to manipulate and harness the weather to adjust the velocity and direction of
            the Airship; Experienced pilots will also be able to manage an Airship through more dangerous weathers, or
            control a larger vehicle without too much assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Airships were first created by the Rock Gnomes of Mechania, though now many different people have learnt the
            art of creating them and put their own flair on their creations. Nevertheless, they all use the same basic
            premise, although whereas those created by the Rock Gnomes tend to generate flame to propel the ship,
            variants that use lightning have been seen more recently, as there is less likelihood of a fire.
        </p>
        <p>
            Airship Pilots are known as Tempestarii. Most of these tend to be storm sorcerers, druids specialising in
            the air and weather, paladins who make an oath with the storms and wizards who have studied their whole
            lives to control the airstreams.
        </p>
        <h2>Canal Boats</h2>
        <p>
            Canal Boats are usually powered by burning various whatever they have on hand and are often noisy, smelly
            and slow. Giant wheels turn to propel them through the water, and travel via canal boat between cities can
            take days, but
            they’re cheaper and easier to build than airships by a sizable margin, and much, much easier to captain.
            Simple and quick for both repair and maintenance, Canal Boats remain a very popular option.
        </p>
        <h2>Pods</h2>
        <p>
            Pods are incredibly expensive. They are like bikes or cars with a single wheel instead of two that you sit inside. Used
            mostly by couriers, the ultra-rich, and the relay-runners in Mechania. Somewhat uncomfortable and noisy,
            this is a trade-off for their impressive speed. Known for being dangerous especially on treacherous terrain.
            Mcgristle was famous for taking one once out into the wilderness. Unsurprisingly, he didn’t return. Pods are powered by
            crushed rubies that are enchanted to smoulder, added to distilled coal tar and used to fuel the steam engine which powers them.
            They are really slow off the mark, accelerate like a slug, but once up to speed their speed can rival even airships.
            Hard to stop with weak brakes, the level of danger involved with driving these vehicles cannot be
            understated. Unsurprisingly, this is a popular sport in Arrenus, and an impressive racetrack weaves through
            the city specifically for this.
        </p>
        <h2>Railways</h2>
        <p>
            For a long time the only railway in the world was in Mechania, which travels from the bottom to
            the top of the mountain. This railway uses captured lightning elementals to power the rails, and the train
            then travels upon these rails. Different, however, is the much later creation of the steam railway that
            travels from Morena to the City of Evernight. Built by the manpower of undead slaves, these rails carry a
            single train called Nightpiercer. A train that uses a combination of steam and necromantic energy to travel
            along the rails at frightening speeds, delivering goods to and from Morena to the Vampire Lords of
            Evernight.
