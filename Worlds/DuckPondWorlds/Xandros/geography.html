        <h1 class="world-page-title">Geography of Xandros</h1>
        <p>
            Throughout the world there is very little grass and greenery, instead most of the land is cracked and barren; an endless rocky tundra of caves and tunnels. Forests are almost entirely wiped out, and trees are few and far between. There are a comparatively miniscule number of humanoids who have seen anything that could come close to resembling a forest since the Sundering.
        </p>
        <p>
            The world, however, is far from a monotony of geography; volcanoes and mountains are commonplace throughout the world, and glaciers that last all year round grow in unusual shapes and sizes. A deep Crevasse spans almost the entire world, delving deep into the world, through the crust and to the very mantle of the earth. This Crevasse is home to vast expanses of both the Nine Hells and the Abyss, and is a platform for the continuous war between Demons and Devils.

            Weather in Xandros is unpredictable and mighty; permanent clouds cover the majority of the sky in a thick, depressing smog. Sunlight is rarely seen, and mostly just filtered through this endless smog, and it regularly rains pure acid from the sky. Ash falls from the sky multiple times a week and electrical storms happen in the higher reaches which airships harness for power. Lightning fish swim endlessly through the thick cloud cover, reaching down to strike at passers by.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is ceaseless volcanic activity throughout the realms, and rivers of lava are not uncommon in Xandros. This weather means few have seen above the clouds, but those that have will tell you of a magnificent sight. Although during the day, only a sickly looking orange Sun can be seen, during the night there are two moons ever-present, with vast spirals of coloured light stretching across the sky like ink from a painterâ€™s brush, showing clearly the gaps in the realms of the Gods where light shines through.
