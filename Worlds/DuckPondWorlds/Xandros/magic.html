        <h1 class="world-page-title">Magic in Xandros</h1>
        <p>
            Magic is a tool that has become a necessity in the world of Xandros. Whether it is for the purpose of
            summoning food and drink, keeping the weather away from cities or imbuing the latest technologies with the
            essences required to maintain them, magic has become a natural part of every day life. Most citizens of
            Xandros can at least call upon minor magics to assist them, such as the ability to produce light or remove
            ash from their clothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Powerful mages are usually incredibly rich, paid vast sums of money to maintain important parts of the city,
            create food and drink for the rich and wealthy or imbue magic into the newest of inventions and creations.
            Despite this, there are very few powerful mages within the world. Instead, there is a vast amount of
            mediocre mages, making their living by doing these tasks on a much smaller level.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of the more powerful magic users throughout the world are sorcerers, not wizards, who are powerful by
            nature not practice. In the world of Xandros, life is dangerous and fast; studying for long periods of time
            may not be possible unless you start life with an advantage. The most notable wizards in the world are
            likely the Mind Flayer Polymaths or the Blue Mages of Lazros. The most notable sorcerers are the Forbidden
            and the Elder Vampire Purebloods of Evernight.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are also powerful priests to be found throughout the world of Xandros; less Gods does not necessarily
            mean less Divine magic; only a change of source, or a smaller focus. The Moon Clerics of Lunethra are known
            to be a very powerful collective, as are the Matron Mothers of Vaâ€™lsharah. Preservation Clerics from the
            Enclave boast powerful defensive magics, and the Clerics of Death and the Grave in Morena keep vast depths
            of knowledge from ancient times in their temples.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite this, the majority of those with arcane talent are found assisting the artificers, builders and
            inventors throughout the world of Xandros. Using simple cantrips and repetitive rituals, they are the mages
            who allow the world to function as it does today. Giving small magics to minor technological instruments,
            these are the magic users who give the world of Xandros enough food to eat, shelter to live beneath, light
            to see with, water to drink and turn the cities to the safe havens they are today. They enable transport and
            trade, communication and protection and all of the small luxuries the rich and powerful take for granted.
