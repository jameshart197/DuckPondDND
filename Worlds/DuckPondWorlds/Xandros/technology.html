        <p>
            Technology isn’t just a feature of the Xandros world, it's a necessity within it. Whether it's the simple
            job of lighting cities beneath the truly dark nights and fairly dim days, protecting cities from the worst
            of the strange weathers of the world, or generating resources within a world severely lacking in them,
            technology is the main feature of cities and even scavenger towns that the players will notice within the
            world of Xandros.
        </p>
        <p>
            Small Techs like drift globes, flashlights, mechanical heaters and forges and such are commonplace within
            the world of Xandros. In the wealthier parts of the world, androids and robots are automated to perform a
            wide variety of tasks that cities simply do not have the populace to facilitate. Airships, Railways, Pods
            and Canal Boats are all forms of transport created with modern technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Technological advances were mostly focussed on to deal with the thick ashfalls that have fallen since the
            Sundering. Extricating the Ash from the rivers, and building covered canals for the purpose of travel were
            some of the biggest jobs that technology was developed for, and to this day canal boats remain the main form
            of transport of goods between cities. Technology has also advanced in many other areas; the creation of
            technological weapons is an area in which constant advances are being made, and blueprints guarded extremely
            carefully. Whether it's pistols and shotguns or mighty thundercannons to be fired from Airships, various
            factions are constantly developing technological weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Technology is also vital in the art of preservation and development of plants and food. Despite the
            relatively small populations within cities, it requires technology to extract nutrients from the sickly
            ground, develop plants beneath the weak sunlight and help animals grow with minimal feed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, technology has become a commodity that the rich can enjoy and revel in the luxury it can provide.
            Whether its hot running water, ambient lighting, swift communication across large distances or their very
            own robot butler, using technology to create comfort is the height of fashion in Xandros’ largest cities.
