        <h1 class="world-page-title">Weather in Xandros</h1>
        <p>
            The Weather of Xandros is a being all on its own. With consistent ashfalls, acidic rain, lightning storms so
            powerful they spawn beasts of primal elemental nature, blizzards that freeze landscapes within minutes and
            droughts, there is little the inhabitants of Xandros do not have to contend with at some time or other.
            Although the ashfalls have lessened over the centuries since the Sundering, they still occur consistently
            throughout the year. Weather also pays little attention to the hemispheres or what one would expect of
            natural weather progression. It snows as much at the equator as it does at the poles, and droughts occur
            seemingly by chance and can last years. Due to this unpredictability of the weather, those who can
            manipulate the weather on a smaller scale are highly valued.
        </p>
        <p>
            Weather magic doesnâ€™t work exactly how you might expect it to however. Determining what weather to expect
            can give results for a tiny area, or a very short duration, and changing or manipulating the weather may
            only adjust it in a small sphere around yourself unless it is an incredibly powerful casting. The Vampires
            that keep the storm clouds over the City of Evernight are powerful wizards who spend most of their days
            casting and re-enchanting cloud tethers.
