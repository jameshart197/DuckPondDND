        <h1 class="world-page-title">Playable Classes in Xandros</h1>
        <p>For the purpose of displaying an alternate world and the changes from the original world-state, certain
            homebrew sub-classes have been added to the world. Many of these are specific to a certain city, race or
            group of people. Details are given for each one below. </p>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Ancient Weapon Master (Fighter) - An Order in Arrenus</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>The Order of the Ancient Weapon Masters are a guard as old as Arrenus itself. When the Bastion was first
                formed in the old Amphitheatre of Gladiators, the gladiators themselves took to defending the populace
                from the monsters that attempted to get in. In honour of their valiant sacrifices and their efforts to
                defend the people, the Order of Ancient Weapon Masters is still retained to this day. </p>
            <p>
                They train with martial weapons as opposed to those made with technology, and wield them more skillfully
                than any others in the land. Although members of any race can join the Order, the majority of the
                members of the Order are Dragonborn, just as the old Gladiators were.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Arcane Gunsmith (Artificer) - Mechania based characters only</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>The art of the Arcane Gunsmith is at once both simple and dangerous. Wielding hand held thundercannons,
                these rock gnomes and mountain dwarves from Mechania are fearsome foes on the battlefield. Maintaining
                these weapons alone takes training and understanding, let alone operating them. Members of the 7th
                Battalion are the only people with understanding of the making and use of these guns, and their
                blueprints are guarded closely. </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Arcane Knight (Sorcerer) - Gith speciality, or someone trained by a
            Gith</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>The Githyanki Arcane Knights are a fearsome combination of magic and blade. Mostly, these warriors are
                found defending the Enclave alongside their Animated Armor units, though a few are found elsewhere in
                the world. They are master tacticians and students of battle from both old and new times.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Arcane Polymath (Wizard) - Mind Flayer only</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Arcane Polymaths are the result of combining near unrivalled intelligence, a hive mind and a requirement
                for magic arcane. Mind Flayers are capable of learning spells of all schools with the same detachment
                that they have studied in all manner of subjects over the years. Maintaining a varied arsenal of spells
                both psionic and arcane, the Arcane Polymaths of Academia are renowned throughout Xandros.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Archivist (Artificer) - Enclave origins</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Primarily members of the Enclave, Archivists are the Enclaves arms, with an incredibly long reach.
                Travelling throughout the world to gather accounts of information pre and post sundering, most
                Archivists have a specialty. Some focus on the new technologies being created, some on pre-Sundering
                wildlife, but each will travel relentlessly to learn all they can.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Blood Arcana (Wizard) - Newton based or trained</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>The Blood Mages of Newton were once the only thing that stood between the Bastion and the mad monsters
                that hounded them. To this day the Order are revered within Newton and entrusted with the city's
                defences. In more modern times, the arts of the Blood Mages have been taught to others, but it was once
                an act of sheer desperation by a group of survivors desperate to cling to life that created this ancient
                order. Any race can be a member of the Blood Arcana, but most of them tend to be human.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Blue Mage (Wizard) - Lazros based and trained
        </button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>When the Bastion upon Lazros was built, there was a group of monks from a nearby monastery that trained
                relentlessly to mimic the arts of monsters and beasts to enhance their abilities. When the Bastion was
                threatened, these monks used their training and combined with the mages from the monastery in an attempt
                to defend the populace. The art of the Blue Mage was born in Lazros, and to this day there are very few
                who study its traditions from outside the city. Entrance to the Monastery of the Blue Mages is
                incredibly exclusive, and just entering the Monastery as an Acolyte by no means guarantees graduation.
                Most Blue Mages are Shifters.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Circle of Adaptation (Druid) - Any origins</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Many adapted to survive the Sundering, but few as much as the Druids had to. The very nature of nature
                was twisted during the Sundering, and many Druids who were left upon the Earth had to change their ways
                and understanding drastically to incorporate the new world around them. Most Druids ended up mimicking
                nature in their every action and decision, channelling the rules of survival of the fittest to cope with
                their new environments.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Circle of Evolution (Druid) - Corpse Orchids get bonuses</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Druids that, after the Sundering, specialised in trying to maintain the flora and fauna of the old world
                ended up as Circle of Evolution Druids. In present times, these Druids are the brave wanderers who
                travel the wilderness to seek new life, be it animal or plant, and care for it. Corpse Orchids are
                plants that have gained sentience and often twist their growths to create companions for themselves by
                awakening plants or taking over beasts as their hosts; their companions are double the CR of other races
                playing this class.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Circle of Air (Druid) - Usually Airship Pilots</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Some Druids who had given up on venturing into the Wilderness and seeing nature first hand instead turned
                their hands to the weather and to controlling Airships, resulting in a specialisation of Air Druids. One
                of the advantages for these pilots is the ability to fly themselves upon the air currents, so even if
                the ship goes down, the pilot will likely survive the drop.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">College of Hymns (Bard) - Lycan recommended</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Students of Hymns of the Old Age, bards who weave divine magic into their songs are known as College of
                Hymns Bards. Through combining traditional bardic techniques with holy guidance, these bards are
                healers, priests and protectors. Originating in the Lycan city of Lunethra, the Songs of Selune in the
                temples there, sung by thousands of wolves calling out for their Goddess, is a sight to be witnessed.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Fate Domain (Cleric) - Any origins</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Clerics of Fate use divine magic to nudge events to their liking, embodying the power of chance and its
                manipulation, and range from whimsical meddlers to wise prophets. Masters of destiny, they pluck the
                threads of fate like a puppeteer, bringing fortune to themselves and their allies, or misfortune to
                their foes. These Clerics rarely pray to a specific deity, instead directing their efforts at Fate
                itself, though some are Patrons of Tymora, remembering her from the Pantheon of Old.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Gadgeteer (Rogue) - Mechania Rock Gnomes/Androids get bonuses</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Gadgeteers are the masters of setting up and disarming traps, finding clever solutions that others would
                not and always having the right tool on hand. These clever mechanics are a vital requirement on an
                airship that canâ€™t afford an Android mechanic. Capable of crafting unusual and helpful items as well as
                upgrading their weapons in various ways, the Gadgeteer is always a useful partner to have around.
                Gadgeteers are usually from Mechania, and are most often Rock Gnomes or Androids. Those that choose the
                Android, Rock Gnome or Dwarf race and a background from Mechania will gain access to the Mending and
                Greater Mending cantrips for free and may create Clockwork Toys, Fire Starts, Music Boxes and
                Flashlights.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Hedge Wizard (Wizard) - Scavenger Town origins</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Studying without restrictions or guidance in the dangerous Scavenger Towns, Hedge Wizards contort the
                rules of classic magic. Able to bind to unusual familiars, contort their bodies into the shape of small
                beasts and connect directly to the planes of the elements, these wizards may be unschooled, but they do
                not lack for power.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Master Summoner (Wizard) - Aaba specialists</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>In the city of Kreegaa and the surrounding lands, the Aaba shamans are known for their wisdom and their
                power. Summoners of great power, at home with the nature around them, despite itsâ€™ unusual contortions,
                these summoners call creatures to their aid for menial tasks or for defence. Whilst others in the world
                may be Master Summoners, only the Aaba can summon more dangerous creatures. Aaba who take this class may
                increase the CR availability within any summon spell by 1.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Master at Arms (Fighter) - Enclave trained or Thri-Kreen</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>There are two iterations of the Master at Arms within the world of Xandros. One is the group of battle
                tacticians trained by the Enclave to lead their Units. The other are the Thri-Kreen battalions within
                the Kreegaa army. Both of these soldiers train relentlessly with old world weapons, combining both hands
                into a skilful fusion of precision and brutality.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Moon Domain (Cleric) - Lycan Only</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>The Clerics of Lunethra are powerful and devoted followers of Selune, dedicated to returning her to
                power. To this end, they have a deep connection with the Twin Moons ever-present in the Xandros sky,
                despite the thick cloud cover. These Clerics maintain a passion for their calling throughout their
                lives, whilst practising their craft with the wisdom of the Elders.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Oath of Storms (Paladin) - Airship Pilot Background available</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>To be Unburdened, Unyielding, Unconquered, Unmuted and Unhesitating is the calling of the Oath of Storms
                Paladin. A Paladin who has made a pact with the ever crackling lightning of the thick clouds of Xandros,
                and learnt to channel it not only in the flying of their beloved Airships, but into battle. These
                Paladins swear by Talos, despite his fall from the Pantheon, and they are a veritable tempest of justice
                and virtue.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Order of the Vampire (Blood Hunter) - NON-vampire, City of Evernight
            based</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>The Nightwalkers are an Order unto their own. The Order of the Vampire are based within the City of
                Evernight and are their most elite guards. Mostly composed of predator races such as Leonin and
                Aarakocra, these already strong mortals take on a level of immortality by embracing the vampiric gifts
                and transferring vampiric blood into their own bodies through dark rituals. These Nightwalkers are
                dedicated and vicious warriors.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Outlaw (Rogue) - Mercenary Background recommended</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>When there are guns, there are those who would use them to their own ends. The Outlaws are those that
                make their own way in the world, oftentimes taking what they need when they need it. They are the
                assassins you pay to rid you of a problem, the thieves who take the treasure you were seeking or the
                Mercenaries who, for the right pay, are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their employersâ€™
                goals.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Path of the Juggernaut (Barbarian) - Animated Armor Enclave origins
            (warforged possible)</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Fearsome are the Animated Armor Juggernauts that the Enclave create to defend their lands. Taught the
                ways of combat by the talented Githyanki Arcane Knights, these brutes use their heavy armor and the
                sheer force of their body to decimate their foes and protect their creators. With deadly force hammers
                attached to each arm, these Juggernauts are an unstoppable force.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Path of the Skald (Barbarian) - Goliath or taught by.</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Revered within the Goliath communities, the Skalds are part storyteller, part musician, part warrior.
                They often are found upon the battlefield amongst their comrades, inspiring them to greater deeds and
                riling them to higher levels of bloodlust. They are fearsome warriors within their own right too; the
                greatest tales of battle are those witnessed from the battlefield itself. Much of the Goliath community
                can be found within the walls of Lunethra, keeping to their ancient traditions and eschewing most
                technology.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Preservation Domain (Cleric) - Enclave Priest (Elf recommended) CANNOT
            do harm</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Sworn never to harm another, Preservation Clerics seek to maintain all elements of life and history. They
                are historians as well as priests, teaching the ways of Oghma and seeking to learn as much as they can
                of the world, past and present. These priests are usually heavily armoured with great tower shields they
                use to protect those from harm who are at risk. They are often found travelling with Archivists
                throughout the world of Xandros, protecting them and learning alongside them.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Pureblood Vampire (Sorcerer) - Vampire only</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>The Elder Vampires within the City of Evernight are a force to be reckoned with. Practised in the arts of
                melee combat and arcane sorcery, they are fast, ruthless and deadly. These vampires have progressed
                beyond fearing sunlight or running water. For the most part, Pureblood Vampires belong to the clan of
                Maison de la Nuit, though some other ancient clans still remain throughout Xandros. Although fearsome
                combatants, you are far more likely to witness a Pureblood in the field of politics than battle.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Witch (Wizard) - Member of the Coven of Shared Truth</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>Witches are learned spellcasters like wizards, but unlike traditional wizards, they gain their magic not
                in schools but at the fringes of society, learning from the shunned and adopting folklore and old ways
                that frighten common folk but offer great power. They bind pieces of their souls to items and creatures
                they create, making them lightning rods for the energies of the universe. It is said that the magic
                witches use is descended from the oldest practices of magic in the multiverse. Most Witches belong to
                the Coven of Shared Truth, believing that knowledge of the Old ways should be shared for mutual benefit.
                Many minor witches throughout Xandros find their way to the Coven sooner or later.
