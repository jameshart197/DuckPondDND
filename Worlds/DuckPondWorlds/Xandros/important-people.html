        <h1 class="world-page-title">People of Importance in Xandros</h1>
        <p>There are many important people within the world of Xandros, but most of the following pertain to the
            campaigin <a href="">Treasure Rats.</a>
            As such, if you are seeking to use this world for your own campaign, or are playing in a different campaign
            relating to this world, you may find that some of
            the following people are not even present in your game.</p>

        <h2>The Crew of the Scarlet Rose</h2>
        <p>The Scarlet Rose is the ship on which the <a href="">Treasure Rats</a> campaign begins, and throughout the
            campaign become regular companions and notable
            allies of the party. Below, a short summary of each is given.</p>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Cleo Kirkland</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/cleo.jpg" alt="An image of Cleo Kirkland" class="character-image">
            <p>Ship Captain and Pilot, Cleo is friendly and fun, but determined. She is a Half-Elf Circle of the Air
                druid, with a familiar called Lance, the Falcon. She is savagely independent, reckless at times and very
                intelligent. She is known for her daring passages through the Walking Mountains and the Knife Peaks and
                her strong magic. She is witty, sarcastic, sharp and daring, and whilst she has a kind heart she leads
                on the ship without question.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">S-3-Fixit</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/s3fixit.jpg" alt="An image of S-3-Fixit" class="character-image">
            <p>The Ship’s repair bot, S3 is extremely willing to help to the point of irritation, exceptionally clumsy
                and very formal in his speech. He is occasionally faulty, but he’s been with the Kirkland family a long
                time and is very loyal. He is programmed in mechanics and repairs more recently, though Cleo thinks she
                was ripped off. He was originally the family’s butler Automaton, and performs both roles equally badly.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Brandy</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/brandy.png" alt="An image of Brandy" class="character-image">
            <p>The Ship’s Chef, vice-captain and Cleo’s right-hand-woman, Brandy is sexist, has no issue with being
                demanding or difficult, regards everyone as her tool to use as she best sees fit. When Cleo isn’t in the
                room, Brandy sees her word as Law. She struggles with humour and sarcasm, being very direct and very
                efficient. Cleo regularly makes subtle jokes at her expense. Is very insecure about her masculine
                demeanour.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Lorelei</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/lorelei.jpg" alt="An image of Lorelei" class="character-image">
            <p>Cleo’s best friend, Lorelei is a High elf with a lot of money, various unusual interests and hobbies and
                absolutely no interest in the day to day running of the ship. Regularly found lazing around reading or
                debating politics and philosophy with Cleo, she is not technically a crew member, though her financial
                assistance keeps the Scarlet Rose afloat. Her relationship with Cleo is often more than just friendly,
                though there is little chance of something monogamous where Cleo is concerned.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Nabrak</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/nabrak.jpg" alt="An image of Nabrak" class="character-image">
            <p>Nabrak is an easily distracted but exceptionally intelligent Rock Gnome who failed to inherit the magical
                powers usually ascribed to his race. He is mostly a scientist and repairman, and his knowledge of flight
                paths, navigation and air currents is second only to Cleo’s. He is always inventing something new and
                equally unfinished.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Yot</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/yot.jpg" alt="An image of Yot" class="character-image">
            <p>It is easy to dismiss Orc Yot as stupid, slow or unaware, but he is a loyal member of the crew, a
                reliable steersman and a good friend to the Kirkland family. He has inherited some Elven blood in his
                past and is already well into his eighties, and looks no older than thirty. Although very strong, he has
                little interest in battle, preferring instead to focus on the Ship and his collections. Yot tends to be
                fairly quiet and private.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Hireable Sidekicks</h2>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Cora</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/cora.jpg" alt="An image of Cora" class="character-image">
            <p>The most consistent of Cleo’s hirelings, Cora is a youthful halfling with a love of adventure, an
                exceptional talent for healing and a total fear of heights and flying. Nevertheless, she regularly
                overcomes this to travel with the ship. She is a healer, knows how to heal mechanicals and biologicals,
                and has a strong belief in her Gods that guides her well in encounters with evil.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Sarge</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/sarge.jpg" alt="An image of Sarge" class="character-image">
            <p>A Tortle once of the Old Guard of Laketon, Sarge is still known to everyone by his rank. Never seen
                without his sword, pistol and shield, Sarge is a hardened soldier who only hires out when its dangerous
                and there’s a good chance of treasure. Cleo finds his habits of spitting and drinking too much
                distasteful. Fighter, Tank, Survival knowledge.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Hank</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/hank.jpg" alt="An image of Hank" class="character-image">
            <p>Hank is a gunslinging Vampire who wants to see the whole world, and is trying to write a book about all
                the monsters in the world. Whilst Cleo thinks he’s stupid for even attempting such a thing, and finds
                his experiments on the dead “for science” abhorrent, he is a strong fighter to have in your corner.
                Gunslinger, Mercenary, Rogue abilities. Hank has been given cybernetic upgrades by Branhaus as an
                experiment due to his vampiric constitution.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Jaxxus</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/jaxxus.jpg" alt="An image of Jaxxus" class="character-image">
            <p>
                A dashing drow rogue with a relaxed sense of moral duty, fast fingers and an eye for the finest
                treasure. Jaxxus is a strong combatant and a quick mind, but although he can be quick to take more than
                his fair share of the treasure, Cleo’s good relationship with Jaxxus is likely due to his good looks and
                centuries of practice in the skills of a lover.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Dex</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/dex.jpg" alt="An image of Dex" class="character-image">
            <p>
                Dex is a Kobold who has an unhealthy obsession with fire. He’s a quick and intelligent mage with a
                complete lack of common sense. With his trademark “BOOM” and his passion for fire, even upon her wooden
                airship, Cleo is not the biggest fan of taking Dex along, but understands that when it comes to large
                numbers of enemies, few are more efficient than the pyromantic Kobold.
