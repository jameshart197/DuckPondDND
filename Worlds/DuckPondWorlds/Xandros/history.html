        <h1 class="world-page-title">The History of Xandros</h1>
        <h2>What was the Sundering?</h2>
        <p>
            The Sundering was the Smiting of the World by Tyr. The Final act of the War of the Gods. The blow was
            blocked by the Shield of Lathander, and ricocheted off into the planes of existence, shattering the boundary
            between them, and nearly bringing about the end of the universe as we know it. Ao, the OverGod, twisted the
            planes back in upon themselves, eradicating some planes, and blending others within the world of Xandros,
            now thought to be the only remaining world containing living creatures in the Mortal Realms.
        </p>
        <h2>Modern History</h2>
        <p>
            Soon after the Sundering, survivors of the destruction began grouping together into places of safety. Whether these places were the caverns inside mountains, the remnants of old cities, or various other refuges; these places became known as Bastions of Civilization. Some of these Bastions thrived, some fell, most were reliant on brave adventuring groups who carried word between them and helped them find valuable resources. The cities of todaysâ€™ world are almost all built upon these Bastions, and still give thanks for their founders to this day. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Although there is little history since the Sundering, as only 300 years or so have passed (current year 312 PS), most of the history is a documentation of the swift advancement of technology, the turning of magic to the art of survival and thriving within the world and the regeneration of civilization. It is a testament to the strength of civilization that it has returned so swiftly to taming the wilderness that is the world. Nonetheless, let it not be mistaken that most of Xandros is still just that; Wilderness.
