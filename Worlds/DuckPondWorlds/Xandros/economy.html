        <h1 class="world-page-title">The Economy of Xandros</h1>
        <p>
            lthough for the most part, the economy in Xandros resembles other games, in that Copper, Silver, Gold and
            Platinum pieces are used for trade all over, and prices are fairly standard all over, it should be noted
            that certain items are much higher in value than they once were. Whilst some of these are the obvious
            resources that certain cities lack, there is also a huge demand for diamond dust, which powers many of the
            technologies of the modern era. Also required are coals, oils and other burnable resources to power the many
            steam contraptions of the time. Metal is consumed in huge quantities and magic is less rare than it once
            was.</p>
        <p>
            It should also be noted that some arts see less focus than was once applicable. You may find potions more
            expensive for example, and because of the lack of knowledge of the Wilderness, perfect maps, guides and
            travel stories of the places in between are extremely valuable. Trade with the Scavenger Townships will
            often be very different to the economies within cities, each having their own price system and sometimes
            their own currency.
