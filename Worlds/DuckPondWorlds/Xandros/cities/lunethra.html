        A city of glass roofed buildings looking out to the moon, and open topped cathedrals. The Lycans built their
        city upon a river that they strive to keep free of ash. The entire city is a dedication to Selune, whom they
        worship and hope to return to the Pantheon of the Gods. The Lycans are the primary residents of Lunethra, but
        many have come to live in this city, protected by high walls and full of beautiful architecture. Although the
        primary food source is the meat hunted from the Wilderness surrounding Lunethra, there are glass greenhouses
        throughout the city where priests of Selune grow plants and supplement their stocks with magic

        Lunethra is a peaceful city, where all are given a say in the running of the city. There is a yearly vote to
        determine the leader of the city, however Anita has held the post of Speaker for the Lycans for almost two
        centuries, a testament to her fair judgement, careful leadership and sense of responsibility.

        Though the Lycans do not disparage technology, they are also one of the few cities not to rely on it, making
        Lunethra a welcoming place for the traditional Goliath Skalds who make this city their home. Others who prefer
        places of less progress and more traditional ways have also come to Lunethra to make this place their home; the
        only requirement is that they acknowledge Selene and respect her ways.
