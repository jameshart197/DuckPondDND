        The City of the Drow, it begins deep in the underdark, and its many levels eventually rise above the surface where thick trees make a canopy upon which farms are built. Built upon the original city of Dutherhezzan, Va’lsharah is the holy city for the Drow and the last remaining Homeland in the Underdark.

        With farms in the Underdark for mushrooms and Deep Rothé, farms above the great canopies producing fruits and plants and the greatest hunters in Xandros in the form of the Drow Hunting parties, Va’lsharah lacks for little. In addition to this, they have deep mines nearby in the underdark where the Duergar, Kobolds and Svirfnebli work the earth and mine metal, gems and precious stones.

        The Drow still follow the guidance of Lolth, though she is far less cruel than she once was, and they still adhere to their matriarchal society. The army of the Drow contains the Gnoll Guard, many Drow mages, clerics and sorcerers and great units of Duergar and Svirfnebli too. The Drow Matriarchs often purchase technology from other places, often for their wizards to study and replicate or improve upon.

        With such wealthy Matrons, and a land rich in resources, Va’lsharah is a rich homeland, and with Lolth’s change of outlook and the lack of slavery, many come to abide here from elsewhere. Of all the cities in Xandros Va’lsharah is the one that trades most often with the Scavenger Townships and others in the Wilderness. Much of this is due to the distance Drow Hunting parties will travel from the city in their exploration and the areas surrounding Va’lsharah immediately are the most well mapped areas of the Wilderness in Xandros.
