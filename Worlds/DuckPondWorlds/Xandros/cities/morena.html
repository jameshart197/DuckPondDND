        Morena was built by the Necromantic Lich Kelemvor, a Fallen Deity. It began when he fell to the Material Plane
        as a mortal and claimed the body of the old Manse of Ilcaraz, once a great mage and rich Lord. He began raising
        undead servants to assist him, and gave them sentience both to keep him company and assist him in his
        endeavours. The Mansion of Ilcaraz was built to be near the large iron mine that the Lord owned, and to this
        day, Morena is the greatest provider of iron and steel in the world.

        With most of the population being awakened undead, there is a lot less focus in Morena on the production of
        food, and what food does come is usually traded via the Nightpiercer - the great steam train running from the
        City of Evernight to Morena, or via the canal to Newton. Morena has the densest population with large numbers of
        undead living in close quarters with little need for sleep or space.

        Within the city there is a council of Undead Lords who, although they answer to Kelemvar, tend to do most of the
        running of the city themselves. Morena is one of the most welcoming and open-minded places in the world;
        everyone is accepted and celebrated for who they are. Kelemvar employs strong magic and sheer manpower to make
        most technologies unnecessary within Morena, though some tech has been adapted and utilised. Due to the
        unwavering purpose and loyalty of the undead to Kelemvar, the army of Morena is extremely well drilled and
        practised.

        Morenaâ€™s culture is very traditional, with slow progression and old fashioned music and cuisine. Despite their
        near-worship of Kelemvor, no religion is practised within Morena and for the most part the population focus on
        working hard and playing hard. As such there is a large variety of bars, restaurants and speakeasies, despite
        the undead having no need to eat or drink.
