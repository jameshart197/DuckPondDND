        Academius is the City of the Mind Flayers, which is built as a series of individual towers with vast
        interconnecting bridges. The city was built around, above and to protect the Elder Brain, known as Yshiggol. It
        is believed that Yshiggol is the last of his kind and therefore the Mind Flayers are extremely protective, even
        to the point that few not of the race know of the existence of the Elder Brain.

        The city is well known for its vast wealth of knowledge and the Psionic power that it boasts, however, during
        and after the Sundering the Mind Flayers thought it prudent given the loss of their many thousands of slaves to
        study Arcane Magic and practice it to help create their city. As such, Academius also contains one of the
        largest repositories of knowledge on the Arcane Arts within the world of Xandros. The city is built within the
        Crater Desert, at the foothill of the mountains and as such lacks for Fresh food and water. Despite this,
        Academius is very welcoming to visitors and many other races live within the city.

        Academius regularly trades information, often mundane, for manual labour and other trade goods. Many of the
        finest craftsmen and artisans reside within its halls, given knowledge of ancient techniques and unusual
        materials in exchange for their work. Due to the vast magical power of the city, few would be stupid enough to
        attempt to breach the city. Academius does, however, lack in modern technologies to an extent; the Mind Flayers
        trade for what they perceive as interesting or useful such as irrigation tech and modern plumbing, but pay
        little mind to technology used for defence or that can otherwise be replaced with magic.

        Due to the loyal and focused nature of the Mind Flayers, the word of the Elder Brain is absolute law, though
        occasionally, often due to the secrecy regarding the Elder Brain, this can be perceived as the Mind Flayers
        ruling the roost over what they perceive to be lesser races.
