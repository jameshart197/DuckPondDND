                Built out of the remains of an old city ruin, centred around the amphitheatre in which the new city was
                founded, this was one of the first bastions within the post-Sundering world. Now a sprawling city
                thought to be the second largest in the world, Arrenus towers over the world around it, being built up
                far more often than outwards, due to the huge walls surrounding the city in concentric rings. There is
                much magic within the architecture, allowing this sprawling metropolis to defy gravity with its towering
                pillars of technology.

                The city is home to a vast array of races and peoples, and the class disparity here is easy for any
                visitor to see. The Ultra-Rich live in sheer luxury in huge mansions surrounded by guards and gardens,
                and the rest of the population live crammed together in terraces and towers of apartments where you can
                barely swing a halfling.

                The city is governed by the Elder Council, a council made up of six delegates who campaign diligently to
                be elected to their position, and pay very well for the privilege. Every four years, elections are held,
                and many a bribe and assassination pave the way for the ruthless leaders of this vast metropolis.
