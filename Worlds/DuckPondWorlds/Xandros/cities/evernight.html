        The City of Evernight is a collection of estates comprising of many old-style buildings, mansions and castles.
        Each of these estates
        is connected by underground passages and magical defenses, as well as by streets above the ground. The Vampires
        of the City of Evernight
        have very much embraced recent technology, and this is displayed everywhere in both the functionality and
        artistry of the city.

        Originated from an estate of a particularly powerful and wealthy vampire clan by the name of Maison de la Nuit -
        mostly survived the sundering due to being set into and alongside the mountain as a heavily defensible position
        and no creature successfully attacked it, especially considering the natural might of the inhabitants.

        The city is connected to Morena by steam powered rail. Most of the city sits on the lowlands surrounding the
        mountain, with the walls of the city itself extending partly up the mountain to provide significantly more
        protection from would-be invaders. These lowlands are a natural floodplain and basin, and streams from the
        mountain congregate here, forming a river which the city was built around, and multiple bridges span the
        tributaries and main river, showcasing the masterful architecture and arch designs of the vampires.

        Hill dwarves, forest gnomes, hobgoblins, humans and many more mortal races make their homes here under the
        protection of the vampire clans. Hills and valleys support vineyards, vampires somehow figured out how to grow
        them. Mountains give access to plenty of ores, stone, and especially gold.

        The city is filled with vampire political intrigue, various families and clans vying for control in their
        schemes and games. Building and architecture is more traditional, relying on masonry, but the vampire architects
        are second to none. They donâ€™t build anything themselves though, usually. They have the dwarves and other
        mortals do that work.. Vampire culture shuns religion, as it gets in the way of their politicking.
