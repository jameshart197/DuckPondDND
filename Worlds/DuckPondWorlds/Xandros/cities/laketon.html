        Laketon is a great city, built into the very centre of a huge lake that many believe contains elements of the
        plane of Water. Laketon is divided into two halves, the AquaCity and Laketon Upper. The AquaCity is fully
        submerged in the lake, and is home to many amphibious races such as the Grunge, Simic Hybrids, Tritons and
        Locathah. It is also home to the Sovereignty; Six Aboleths who rule the city with an iron fist, and have many
        permanently under their sway.

        Laketon’s primary resource is water, and much of their magic and technology is devoted to the cleansing of the
        waters and maintenance of the lake that is their livelihood. They also do not lack for food, with underwater
        farms and fish providing much fresh nourishment. Much of Laketon’s trade is with Kreegaa, who trade their iron
        and wood from their forests in exchange for the fresh water of Laketon and the delicacies from the lake.

        Surrounded by a lake with the powerful psionic Aboleths under the city, Laketon doesn’t lack for defense.
        Nonetheless, the Laketon army is one of the best trained armies in the world, combining the tactical might of
        the Tortles with the sheer physical power of the Minotaur Horde. This army is also incredibly well outfitted
        with the latest in weaponry and technology, as well as psionic and magic defenses.The Flumphs who work as army
        support units, providing healing and psionic defense are some of the most advanced tactical healers and supports
        in Xandros

        Underwater, further defenses lie in the Triton and Locathah armies, who are equally well trained and outfitted,
        but specialise in fighting under water. When Laketon was first built, it had to contend with a Demon Horde from
        the nearby Crevasse as well as many vying for the waters surrounding it. Needless to say, their current strength
        is a result of this. The Sovereignty also employ slavery, usually through mind control, of many beasts, monsters
        and others, creating great wonders of art and magnificent buildings within the city through sheer manpower.
