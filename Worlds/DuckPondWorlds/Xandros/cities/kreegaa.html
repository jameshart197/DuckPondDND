        Built within a sliver of Elysium, adjacent to a small pocket of Celestia, Kreegaa is home to some of the
        greenest lands in all of Xandros. Jealously guarded by the fierce Aaba and Thri-Kreen, this is where they built
        their home after arriving from a far away realm during the Sundering. The architecture within these lands is a
        little simplistic, but no less magnificent than the greenery surrounding it, with the Insectoid races building
        large hives in pyramidal shapes hiding their food stores and treasuries at the very centre.

        Kreegaa would be coveted by many other lands if it wasnâ€™t for the ring of poison spore mushrooms grown around
        this verdant land. Thought to be a remnant of an old grove, twisted by the forces of Pandemonium, passing
        through these groves is near impossible for most races, and as such, most can only visit the lands of Kreegaa by
        Airship.

        Kreegaa is a peaceful land designated by the two Queens, one of the Aaba and one of the Thri-Kreen. The people
        are rigidly traditional and incredibly loyal to their species, making the way of life in Kreegaa very
        simplistic, but fair and balanced. There is no crime in Kreegaa, and those lucky enough to be allowed to live
        here who are not of the insectoid races find it close to living in paradise.
