                The City of Newton is a massive, sprawling metropolis, by far the largest city in the new world, with
                room, and desire, to grow even further still. It sits where the old world city of Barjinia could once be
                found. During the cataclysmic event, the old city collapsed as the land itself caved beneath it,
                plunging the ruins underground. Since then, these ruins have been picked clean, with many areas cleared
                to make way for new developments.

                While some cities are built upwards, Newton is quite the opposite- many residential and public service
                districts can be found on street level, but the industrial heartbeat of the city comes from below
                ground, in the industrial districts. These can be accessed by many stairwells and other forms of entry
                points scattered throughout the city. In these districts, extensive rail and road networks connect huge
                factories and manufacturing facilities to one another, where their production lines churn out the many
                goods and luxuries the city has come to enjoy.

                A heavily industrialised and technologically advanced city requires an abundance of resources to
                operate, and the wealthy owners of the factories source their raw materials from many of the other
                cities. Coal from nearby mines is brought in by rail, and anything from further is delivered by cargo on
                boats, or particularly, by airship. Newton is home to a massive airship port, with enough capacity to
                load and unload an entire fleet of cargo ships, making it the primary and most preferred method of
                importing and exporting goods.
            </p>

                The city is well protected by both an army and a city guard, as well as a reinforced concrete wall that
                defines the borders of the city. This wall has been moved twice by magic, but for the most part the city
                is built vertically and thus the walls are unlikely to move again. Upon these walls sit guns, turrets
                and platforms for wizards to cast their spells from. The city of Newton is also the Headquarters for the
                Sorcerer’s Syndicate and as such can call upon great magical aid when required.

                Within the city of Newton, the various castes of the city are segregated, living in separate precincts.
                In the bowels of the city, beneath the ground surrounding the industrial centres, live the Uncaste. The
                Uncaste are criminals, outcasts, people that are shunned for one reason or another. These individuals
                live in the dark, damp streets surrounding the Factories of the City Below.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the Serf’s Precincts (one in the outskirts, one below the ground) live the Serfs who work the
                factories and do the most undesirable of jobs (such as sweeping and disposing of waste). In concentric
                rings moving inwards (and often upwards) we then have the Workers’ Precinct, the Merchants’ Precinct,
                the Noble Precinct, the Aristocrat’s Precinct and at the centre of the city is the Lords’ Quartier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Travel between Precincts can be difficult for those wishing to move inwards. There are guard stations
                and police headquarters within each district, and the barrier between precincts is as much social as it
                is physical. It is usually quite easy to tell which precinct a person comes from simply by their dress
                and manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite this Caste system, every Caste from the Serfs up lives a perfectly adequate life by their own
                standards. The Serfs want not for food nor shelter, and are paid decently despite their large numbers.
                Newton is a city of wealth and resources and shares these well. An uprising from the lower Castes could
                be catastrophic; 35% of the city are Serfs, and 40% are workers. Serfs and Workers are also paid 50
                platinum pieces per child that they birth. This is to encourage the increase of the population and to
                ensure the well-being of any new children.
