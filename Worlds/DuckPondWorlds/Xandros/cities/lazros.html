        The Three Towers were standing long before the creation of Lazros. Fircula, Narros and Andrasta have stood for
        millenia, as did the Blue Monastery nearby. When the Sundering struck, the monks from the Blue Monastery came to
        the towers for shelter, and protected others there, learning the arts of the mages present and adapting their
        ways to the monsters in the wilderness around them. Even today, there is a great reverence for the Blue Mages
        and their arts within Lazros, and the Triumvirate have absolute rule over the city.

        Lazros is discernible from a long distance away by its iconic bubble of pure atmosphere that keeps the city
        temperate and beautiful. Inside the bubble there are crop farms, fresh running water and various other magics
        that are wondrous to all that visit. Due to the magical power of Lazros, they want for little and live in
        relative paradise. There are fewer people in Lazros than any other city, and the city is far less welcoming to
        outsiders and strangers than most.

        Lazros trades a lot of the food they create via airship and via carts to local townships. They also are the only
        city who fishes at sea, braving the furious storms and unusual tidal patterns for delicacies and fish. What
        technology there is in Lazros is mostly employed in the ships they send out to sea, for magic replaces most
        technology within the city. Many extremely rich collectors and artisans retire to Lazros for the beauty and the
        peace that it offers.

        The Blue Mages worship Meilikki and all citizens are required to do the same. Her temple in Lazros can seat over
        forty thousand people comfortably and does so on a regular basis, its great ceiling transparent, allowing the
        congregation to look up at the skies in their worship.
