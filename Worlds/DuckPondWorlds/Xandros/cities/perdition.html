        When the Sundering occurred the Tarterian Depths of Carceri, known to many as simply the prison of the cosmos,
        was broken open. Many foul creatures and beasts resided within the prison. The most renowned of these prisoners
        were the Forbidden, a race of powerful sorcerers who enhance their magic further by consuming arcana contained
        within worlds. This has the… unfortunate side effect of consuming worlds too.

        Since the Sundering, the Forbidden have come to realise that to consume the world of Xandros would leave them
        with no world in which to survive. As such, they are now just powerful sorcerers, and have built themselves a
        city in which to live. That city is Perdition, and in its construction the Forbidden combined their power to
        create a tower that would house them all in great comfort and be defensible from all sides. They then expanded
        the city around the central tower using their magic to allow others to come and reside in the city around them.
        The Central Tower glows with an innate light, as does every single spire within the city, giving Perdition a
        somewhat beautiful but eerie visage.

        Within Perdition, the word of the Forbidden is absolute law. Though they tend to argue with each other about
        small things, and debate for months over philosophical matters, in the matter of the running of the city they
        all seem to be in agreement. Those that reside in the surrounding city are protected and otherwise left to their
        own devices. This allows the Forbidden to play their inter political games and continue with their vices and
        competitions.

        Due to the powerful nature of the cities’ leaders, Perdition wants for little, as much is summoned, multiplied
        and created through magic. The Forbidden acknowledge the existence of a Pantheon but care little for it. Many
        have been sold to the Forbidden as slaves and servants within the tower, but once sold are never seen again. Due
        to this, most give Perdition a wide berth. It does, however, have an excellent landing platform for airships a
        fair way up the tower.
