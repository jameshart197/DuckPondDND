                Mechania is the mountain city carved out of the mountain itself by the rock gnomes, mountain dwarves,
                and duergar. Formed by the clockwork soul sorcerer, Kronos, who sheltered a small tribe of mountain
                dwarves within the cave networks of the mountain. Inspired, the dwarves learned everything they could
                from their magical benefactor, combining the arts with their long-standing traditions. This shift in
                culture and magical ability is still present today, and so many dwarves can be found as proficient
                artificers and gadgeteers within the confines of the city.

                Key features include the electrified railway, spiralling from the depths of the city to its upper
                reaches, powered by captured lightning elementals. The rail currently only has one track, and one train
                with multiple carriages, including some extra carriages at the rear of the train for carrying cargo
                across the city. Because of the singular line and train operating on the network, wait times can be
                somewhat lengthy.

                At the peak of the mountain sits a sizable, and powerful observatory where gnomish and dwarvish
                astronomers study what lies in the great beyond. Unusually for a city, the airport and dock is not at
                the highest points of the city, but rather sits lower down the mountain, perched on a smaller peak which
                juts out from the mountain ranges slightly. Passengers and cargo are then transported to other parts of
                the city along the powered rail system.

                Deeper within the city, within the cave networks where the mountain dwarves first took shelter, the deep
                gnomes of the city manage an extensive mushroom farm, cultivating the many varieties of mushrooms used
                for their various purposes- be they for food, alchemy, dyes, or other such uses. Alongside these are the
                duergar, who raise herds of livestock that can thrive within the caverns, such as deep roth√©. This is
                one of the most reliable sources of meat, textiles and animal horns that the city depends on.

                The races primarily found within the city are gnomes (rock and deep), dwarves (mountain and gray),
                hobgoblins, goblins, kobolds and the many androids and automatons they have created.
