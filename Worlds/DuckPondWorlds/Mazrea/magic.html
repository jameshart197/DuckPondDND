      <h1 class="world-page-title">Magic in Mazrea</h1>
      <p>
        Magic in Mazrea is extremely commonplace, with many of the common folk
        able to cast a simple cantrip or two. There are many practitioners of
        the Arcane in Mazrea, though most are small time tricksters, apprentice
        wizards or those who have learnt a small amount of magic to assist in
        their daily lives (tradesfolk learning things such as mage hand or mold
        earth for example).
      </p>
      <p>
        Those with more magic tend to be wizards who have spent long years
        researching their arts and gathering spells to their spellbooks. Those
        to whom magic comes innately, usually referred to as sorcerers, are
        fairly unusual, and those who receive the Arcane magics in other ways
        are few and far between. With that being said, there are many
        non-humanoids who claim the Arcane Arts as part of their nature, though
        they aren't all that common to see.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many churches, temples and other places of worship where one
        might encounter priests with the ability to cast Divine Magic spells, at
        least to some extent - Rare is the priest that can cast higher magic
        such as Greater Restoration, or even raising the dead. Paladins and
        Clerics of these orders often claim some level of Divine magic also, and
        there are many Rangers and Druids found throughout the world who have
        some level of more natural magic.
      </p>
      <p>
        As such, magic is not regarded with fear or surprise, at least at lower
        power levels (those that can cast spells of up to second level) however
        more powerful casters may garner some reputation and become known to
        authorities in the lands they travel. Throughout Mazrea, laws on magic
        do differ, however the following are fairly common rulings;
      </p>
      <h2>Summoning</h2>
      <p>
        It is considered inappropriate to summon creatures of a monstrous
        nature, or any of whom are demon, devil or undead, within civilised
        lands. If you do have a servant of an unusual nature, it is appropriate
        to ask them to wait for you somewhere away from villages and towns. That
        being said, it is expected that you will use any magic available to you
        to defend yourself, and should you summon such a creature in defence of
        your own life, and dismiss it before it can wreak any havoc upon the
        lands around you, your use of such spells will generally be accepted.
      </p>
      <h2>Necromancy</h2>
      <p>
        Necromancy, specifically the process of reanimating the dead, or causing
        a corpse to rise, is considered distasteful in civilised lands, and
        illegal within bigger towns and cities. It is not uncommon for a temple
        practitioner to speak with the dead, but to raise them to a state of
        undeath is almost unanimously feared and abhorred. Those who do have
        undead servants are advised to disguise them well or risk being feared
        as a warlock or lich and attacked in defence of the surrounding lands.
      </p>
      <h2>Changes to specific spell</h2>
      <h3>The following spells have been removed/banned;</h3>
      <ul class="ul-bulleted">
        <li>Silvery Barbs</li>
        <li>Comprehend Languages</li>
        <li>Identify</li>
        <li>Tongues</li>
        <li>Distort Value</li>
        <li>Modify Memory</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Detect Magic</h3>
      <p>
        When casting this spell, it will only reveal the presence of magic in
        general. An Arcana check (and perhaps others) will be needed to discern
        anything further.
      </p>
      <h3>Locate Animals/Plants/Creature/Object</h3>
      <p>
        These spells are blocked by any lead, as well as by large walls of stone
        or natural land (such as when the object is deep underground, or within
        a castle).
      </p>
      <h3>All spells with a duration of 8 hours</h3>
      <p>
        All spells with a duration of 8 hours will last until the end of your
        next long rest, regardless of when they were cast.
