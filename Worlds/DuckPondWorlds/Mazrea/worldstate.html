      <p>
        Mazrea is a very diverse world, with culture, geography and politics
        changing drastically from country to country, and even within countries.
        There are, however, some similarities across the whole of Mazrea. Magic
        is prevalent throughout the world, with cantrips being commonplace for
        many citizens in the world. Whilst higher level mages are not
        particularly common, there are many priests, sages and wizards
        throughout the world who have access to a fairly strong level of magic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, the level of technology throughout the world tends to be at a
        similar stage of development, with very little scientific progression in
        the world. Whilst there are some small factions doing low level
        experimentation with gunpowder and some very simplistic contraptions
        have been created to improve functionality in farming, production and
        war.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are, however, a large number of plants with magical properties
        throughout Mazrea, which has resulted in a very high level of alchemy
        within the world, especially where remedies and potions are concerned.
        Potions are widely available within the world, and even local alchemists
        are often capable of powerful concoctions if they can source the
        ingredients.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also many powerful and magical creatures in the world of
        Mazrea, from giants and dragons to natural magical creatures and
        elementals. It is thought that the inherent magic within the world
        contributes to the large numbers of these creatures, though the
        prevalence of magic use in Mazrea, including the summoning of creatures
        and opening of portals to other planes, may have been instrumental also.
      </p>
      <p>
        There have been many monumental events in the history of Mazrea, from
        the Emergence of the Giants, to the lowering of the Veil of Chimvaya,
        from the Darkness of Tharizdun to the Sealing of the Moon Elves in
        Beldania, and the latter Wild Elf War in the same country. Vast,
        world-changing events seem to happen once or twice a century within
        Mazrea, potentially due to the powerful magic in the lands. Thereâ€™s
        always a call for adventurers and heroes within all the lands of Mazrea,
        and there likely always will be.
