      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Gallania</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Gallania is the Land of Dragons; throughout history Gallania has been
          a land shared between Dragons and humanoids. The majority of the
          population of Gallania has always been Dragonborn, and there has never
          been a definitive ruler or leader of the nation as a whole, instead
          being broken down into the territories of various warlords, clans and
          dynasties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much of Gallania has been settled and administered by these various
          clans and dynasties without change for decades or even centuries; not
          all territories are fought over anymore. Most of these dynasties are
          areas surrounding the primary city or town of that clan, for example
          Ushma has an area around it owned by the Ushma clan, that then borders
          with Jeras and Lahas and their surrounding territories.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are, however, areas of Gallania where border skirmishes and clan
          fighting has been happening constantly for much of history. Some of
          these are formal battles that take place on specific dates with rules
          and regulations to prevent too much unnecessary loss of lives. Others
          are subject to continued brutal and violent skirmishes and raids
          throughout the year that cause relentless pressure on both clans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the last 100 years, a Warlord named Kyza’an, a black Dragonborn
          with a strong prowess for magic who rose to the leadership of Clan
          Vazra, began to not only skirmish with clans at his border, but invade
          them fully. Much of the land that he invaded was once known as the
          Savage Lands, lands belonging to non-Dragonborn clans and tribes who,
          in the past, protected the land stubbornly and forcefully. During
          these last 100 years, much of Northern Gallania has been changed by
          the war, and the lands are now known as the Savage West and the
          territory of Vazra, with other cities and towns having been built by
          Kyza’an, who called himself Emperor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the violent nature of the civil war causing many issues across
          Northern Gallania, Emperor Kyza’an also provided huge opportunities
          for many of the common folk of the land, whether through employment in
          his armies, or in the building of his grand cities and their
          buildings, or through huge improvements to education, infrastructure
          and administration of these lands.
        </p>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Beldania</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Beldania is a naturally magical land divided into countries with
          fairly strict borders. Until recently, these countries were divided by
          the races that inhabited them, though over the last half-century or so
          diversity within the countries has increased. Even so, many within
          Mazrea see a specific country of Beldania as their home land (the
          Genasi even call the city in Beldania “Homeland”).
        </p>
        <p>
          Beldania has a very diverse collection of Biomes, from the Haellian
          desert to the giant forests of Vuralia, the magically dense crystal
          jungle of Gzellen and the drylands of Muegos. Yukken is a dense
          jungle, and there are various mountain ranges throughout Beldania.
          Rivers flowing from various places in Beldania often converge at the
          Lake of Stars, at the centre of which sits a giant whirlpool.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beldania is regarded as “the first land” by many, and in the time
          before The Constellation, when Old Gods walked the lands, Beldania was
          thought to be the only inhabited land. Certainly the history of Elves
          (which tends to predate most other histories) begins in Beldania. For
          such a small land, more tragedy, catastrophe and change has come from
          Beldania than anywhere else in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beldania is also home to the Manufactory, a large company formed by 3
          artificers long ago that is now the biggest producer of magical items
          in the world, and the only company to mass-produce and distribute
          potions and magical goods. The Manufactory also retains strong ties to
          the Academy of Shar, a school of magic renowned worldwide where all
          formidable (and wealthy) magic users study for at least some period of
          time. The Academy sits on the island of Shar, a short distance from
          the shores of Beldania.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also a small island off the coast of Beldania, Mymna-Kolrik has become
          more known to the general world in recent times. A land full of seers
          and mystics, many now visit to find their fortune, locate someone or
          something they have lost or seek to twist fate to their own ends.
          Despite its reputation as a land of danger and mystery (or perhaps
          because of it), and the fact many who seek Mymna-Kolrik’s shores do
          not make it, it has become an attractive destination for the rich, the
          ambitious and the foolish.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Kelaan</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Kelaan is a land of riches and storied history. Although much of the
          beauty and magnificence of the grand cities, spectacular architecture
          and infrastructure of Kelaan is tainted by slavery, it is
          unquestionable that Kelaan is a land of beauty and power. Power has
          always been a struggle throughout Kelaan, and the land was once
          divided into various countries, which now make up the regions of
          Kelaan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The capital of Kelaan is Galvynia, and there is no larger city in all
          of Mazrea, and the palace of Galvynia is a masterclass in luxury,
          opulence and lavish display of wealth and power. Much of Kelaan is
          divided into the estates and surrounding lands of the wealthy and
          powerful, and the towns and cities they have built.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a fair amount of natural beauty in Kelaan, specifically in
          the Glurvyndale, the lakes and mountains of Morendral, and the
          beautiful coastline of Western Kelaan. These natural lands are
          preserved in their beauty and laws protect them from urban
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a vast cultural and racial diversity within Kelaan, with
          almost all races of Mazrea found somewhere in the large cities and
          towns. The population of Kelaan is many times larger than that of any
          other lands of Mazrea, and the city of Galvynia houses more people
          than many small countries elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whilst the rulership of Kelaan unquestionably belongs to the Sha’Rizai
          family, the politics of the dukes, lords and other titled nobles of
          the land are vicious and dangerous. Kelaan is a land where the class
          system is openly visible to everyone, the wealth disparity is shocking
          and the disregard for human life is often horrifying, all cloaked in
          an opulence of affluence and luxury.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">The Archipelago</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Archipelago of Mazrea is a strange amalgamation of dozens of
          different cultures, biomes, lands and populations with vast contrast
          throughout. From the dense forests of the Cartara Wilds in Endreach to
          the opulent city of Goldtown, from the Shifting Sands of Phorek and
          the sprawling bazaars of Maregal to the sparse icelands of Nenra and
          Narthuul, the Archipelago is as varied as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no one designated ruler of any particular area of the
          Archipelago, though there are many lands with different politics and
          government depending on their size, location and administration. The
          Storm Mist Citadel is home to the Storm King who has absolute rule
          there, Goldtown is ruled by the Conclave of Lords, Endreach is mostly
          a tribal land with no rulers but Maregal is unquestionably ruled by
          the Sultan, Durbryn is a proud free port though the Four Ships are
          certainly responsible for its administration.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Aerwell, the chieftain can only be a woman and she fights for her
          right to rule through a series of battles and strength challenges.
          Astrium has had a king for generations, though he doesn’t assert his
          right to rule and leaves most of the administration of Voldarr to his
          parliament. Yveslen has been ruled by the same elf for a millenia and
          the Glimmer is the safest forest in the entirety of Mazrea, whereas in
          the Swelled Tangles a Thri-Kreen tribe may well kill you on sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          As such, the Archipelago is a place of adventure, opportunity and
          diversity with a healthy dose of danger. It is vital to understand the
          microcosm of government, power or politics that you are visiting,
          whilst also understanding the natural dangers. There are more deadly
          predators, wild elementals and dangerous men in the Archipelago than
          anywhere else in the world, and the natural dangers are no less. From
          stormy seas and ice floes to relentless desert sands, dense jungles of
          dangerous plants to perilous frozen crags, black wastelands of
          volcanic ash to deadly marshes and bogs, the natural dangers of the
          Archipelago are constant and trying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within this strange conglomeration of unusual governments, anarchies
          and pirates, natural and unnatural dangers and strange customs are
          countless places of beauty, cultural diversity and adventure. For the
          aspiring hero, mercenary group of adventuring troupe, no land offers
          more chances for fame and riches, with countless unexplored ruins,
          ancient mage’s towers and dark dungeons, with the remnants of hundreds
          of civilizations and leaders that faded into obscurity, the
          Archipelago is as enticing as it is deadly.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Chimvaya</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Chimvaya is a myth to many in the lands of Mazrea, though accurate
          histories and old maps will tell you what it was and where it once
          was. The critters of Chimvaya will tell you that its still there, if
          you can call it home. Chimvaya is a land of perfect peace and harmony,
          a community of various critter-like creatures and the world tree
          living in unity. Whilst there are scatterings of the various critters
          of Chimvaya throughout Mazrea, and a few do leave the island each
          generation, for the most part, Chimvaya is a unique land of complete
          isolation from the rest of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chimvaya is aware of the outer world, though for many millennia it was
          not, but it is uninterested mostly, instead preferring the peace and
          joy of the land of plenty. Chimvaya has very little influence on the
          rest of the world, and most of the rest of the world are unaware of
          its existence.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Gaerik Northlands</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Gaerik Northlands is the large snow-covered land to the far North
          of Mazrea and the few islands that cling to it. These lands are
          treacherous and cold, with vast stretches of barren lands between the
          small towns and fishing villages that cling to their existences across
          the continent. The Vedalken, Goliaths, Kenku and some tribes of
          Loxodon make these lands their home, whilst others either visit or
          attach themselves to one of these communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only Xandrik has become a multicultural and diverse place over time,
          mostly based on the fishing trade there, though over time other rare
          goods have been traded there that are thought of as commonplace in the
          Northlands, such as scrimshaw and a rare silver stone that emanates
          heat.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Llarnikasia</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Llarnikasia is a barren land of giant mountains and ice cliffs with
          shifting floes and regular earthquakes. In addition, there is one of
          the largest volcanoes in Mazrea, known simply as Infernus, that erupts
          two or three times a decade. There is one single walled city on
          Llarnikasia, called Urveswallyn, though it is often completely
          abandoned. It is believed to belong to the nomadic snow Tabaxi who are
          indigenous to the lands, and who follow the caribou on their seasonal
          migrations. Very few visit these lands, and those that do often report
          strange happenings and unusual phenomena that do not necessarily match
          up with other reports.
