      <h1 class="world-page-title">Transport in Mazrea</h1>
      <p>
        Transport throughout Mazrea is done mostly on foot, by horse or wagon or
        along rivers and canals via boat. There are many boats available for
        river transport and booking a board upon a ship to cross an ocean is
        usually fairly simple. Booking board on a boat or ship will often
        require you to assist with simple duties, though paying more can usually
        avoid this. Private cabins on such boats and ships are extremely rare,
        and as such you will usually be expected to sleep with the other
        deckhands and crew. Most travellers prefer to join caravans of merchants
        with wagons and horses making their trips in groups for safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teleportation or other means of magical transport are mostly limited to
        those wizards who are capable of doing so themselves, though some mages
        capable of such magics will offer their services at fairly exorbitant
        prices. Teleportation is available between various Mageâ€™s Guilds, though
        this often also comes at a fairly expensive service fee, and even
        members must make a small payment when taking such trips.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is considered bad practice and uncourteous to teleport within the
        walls of a city, or even directly into a town or village, though it is
        only illegal in Galvynia, Kelaan and the Storm Mist Citadel of the
        Archipelago. Some places, especially palaces and castles, have magic in
        place to prevent anyone from teleporting within their walls, regardless
        of their stature in the country and familiarity with the owners.
