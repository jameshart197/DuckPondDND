      <h1 class="world-page-title">The Underdark</h1>
      <p>
        The Underdark is a vast interconnected system of subterranean caves,
        caverns and tunnels beneath the surface of Mazrea. Anywhere in the world
        you can find land, thereâ€™s almost always some form of the Underdark
        accessible, even on the islands of the Archipelago. Many parts of the
        Underdark do not directly link with others, so coming to the surface and
        re-entering elsewhere may be necessary in some places. Many races and
        creatures live within the Underdark, and it is widely regarded as more
        dangerous than the surface of Mazrea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those beneath the surfaces of Mazrea have various names for the regions
        of the Underdark, and there is no map of most of it, but a few names
        surface in all tongues;
      </p>
      <h3>The Abyssal Depths</h3>
      <p>
        The Abyssal Depths are universally known as the deepest parts of the
        Underdark where a bottom can often not be found, these endless plunges
        into darkness are often warm and inhabited by the vilest and largest of
        creatures. There is often magical darkness as well as natural present in
        these places, and nowhere else in Mazrea can more strange aberrations of
        nature and creatures of shadow be found. There are few humanoids found
        here, and those that can be found are usually best avoided.
      </p>
      <h3>The Shadowlands</h3>
      <p>
        Often a misnomer, the Shadowlands are named as such because of the
        presence of light, not the absence. Only in the presence of light can
        shadows be cast, and this large expanse of the Underdark is mostly
        beneath Kelaan. Wide expanses of caves and caverns lit by the strange
        glowing crystals indigenous to the region result in vast amounts of
        mining and excavation.
      </p>
      <h3>Deeproot</h3>
      <p>
        Deeproot is mostly found beneath Gallania, and is just below the deepest
        roots of the greatest trees. These vast caverns often house underground
        cities of the Deep Gnomes, Duergar, Drow and other Underdark-Dwelling
        races. Whilst they are the most civilised parts of the Underdark, they
        are often also the most dangerous, as these humanoids will often kill
        other races on sight, or take them as slaves.
      </p>
      <h3>The White Wastes</h3>
      <p>
        The White Wastes are a strange area of the Underdark where steam and
        mists are perpetually present. Found beneath the oceans and the
        Archipelago for the most part, these subterranean caverns often contain
        large amounts of water and volcanic activity, which combine to layer
        these caverns with thick fogs and eerie mists. These areas are avoided
        by all but the most dangerous or foolhardy of creatures, and few that
        visit return from their expeditions.
