      <p>
        There are six different pantheons worshipped within Mazrea. Whilst the
        Constellation is the most widely followed religion in the world, there
        are many followers of other religions spread across Mazrea; Many people
        acknowledge the Constellation whilst also following more traditional or
        local beliefs simultaneously. Whilst some religions may seem limited to
        specific races or lands, there are followers of all religions from many
        different races and from all over Mazrea. The six religions of Mazrea
        are as follows;
      </p>

      <h2>The Constellation</h2>
      <p>
        The Constellation is the most popular Pantheon in Mazrea. Worship of the
        varied Gods and their relevant constellations dates back as far as any
        can remember. Many follow all the Gods, some worship a specific God in
        the Constellation.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Andromeda</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Andromeda once moved Orion eight times trying to get the perfect blend
          of beauty and putting Orion down just the right amount. She is known
          as the re-arranger of stars. Andromeda is known for creating the stars
          and skies themselves, and for guiding the Evenstar through the sky as
          an everlasting light to those that follow her. Andromeda was once a
          beautiful woman who sacrificed herself so that others may live, in the
          Cosmos she is a star pattern depicting a woman who bends herself so
          that others may rest upon her back. She is the Goddess of Generosity,
          or Kindness and of Martyrdom. Those that follow Andromeda believe that
          you should give more of yourself than you receive from others,
          creating a world of beauty and harmony.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Aquila</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Aquila is the Eagle constellation, God of the Lost, carrier of
          messages. Aquila once carried the lost child, Xanthi, to her lover
          across the Cosmos after they were separated within the sky. Many
          believe that the Eagle will watch over those that are lost to them, or
          carry messages upon the wind. Aquila is often the God of separated
          lovers, those who hold the home whilst others are at war or those who
          miss a lost loved one. Aquila is the constellation of an eye, depicted
          as always watching over those who are lost.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Aquoris</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Water God, Aquoris and Carina rule the Oceans together. Unlike his
          counterpart, Aquoris is less associated with the ocean than with water
          itself. Depicted as a single teardrop, Aquoris is a God of both sorrow
          and resilience. Of strength in the hardest of times. Those that follow
          Aquoris often say that water will bend to accommodate any
          circumstance, but never lose its vitality. Aquoris is seen as the God
          of life itself, and once sustained Auriga on his journey through the
          Great Desert when he carried Carina.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Auriga</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          God of travel, Auriga once carried the child Carina across the stars
          to be reunited with her Father. Auriga is mostly special to those who
          live a nomadic life. Auriga depicts a chariot riding to war, and thus
          Auriga is often an omen of war to come when seen brightly in the night
          sky. Many who follow Auriga are the Heralds of armies or those who
          will announce the coming of others. Auriga looks over those who make
          long journeys to seek justice and truth.
        </p>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Canis</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Canis once chased Ursa through the skies for several millennia until
          he put Ursa back in the right place, and returned to the side of the
          Huntsman. The Huntsman's Dog, chaser of dreams, tracker of aspiration.
          Canis is the God of Ambition. Many look to Canis for the furthering of
          their goals, such as those who seek a specific place in the world.
          Huntsmen, assassins and ambitious politicians may follow Canis.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Carina</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Carina is Goddess of the Seas. Depicting the ship upon which other
          Gods travel through the sky upon, she is the Bringer of Storms and the
          Auror of Calm simultaneously. Carina once struck Fornax with a single
          lightning bolt that scattered him into the many shards we see him as
          today, because he mocked her beauty. Carina is a Goddess to the proud
          and the humble alike, as sailors tend to be; proud of their courage
          and bravery, but humble before their Goddess who is, ultimately, the
          sea itself. She is a harsh mistress, but those that follow her never
          waver.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Cepheus</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Cepheus is the God of Law and Justice. Strong spirited, noble and
          brave, he seeks justice where injustice is found, truth amongst the
          lies and law in a land of chaos. Cepheus is Divine Truth itself, and
          is often the judge that rules over disputes between other Gods.
          Cepheus once sentenced Serpens to death for becoming a law unto
          himself, leading to his Ascension. Cepheus is God to those who bring
          law in their own lands, or seek to right injustices that they
          themselves have suffered.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Cetus</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Whale of the Sky; Cetus was once a simple beast, but as he grew to
          be the biggest animal of the seas, there was nothing left for him
          there, and little space. Finally the wise old whale outgrew the sea,
          and decided to swim the skies instead, trailing stars in his wake.
          Cetus is the God of Calm, Peace and Tranquility. Those that follow
          Cetus tend to be fishermen, wanderers and other lone folk who prefer
          to travel to their own tune than follow the way of others.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Cygnus</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Goddess of Grace and Beauty, Cygnus depicts the Swan. The object of
          Norma’s love, creating the jealousy that fired his feud with Tucana.
          Cygnus preaches Beauty above all else, and regards faithfulness in
          love as a pointless action. Many artists and painters follow Cygnus.
          Cygnus is depicted in the night’s sky as the Swan that graces the
          waters of the Cosmos. Although often described as a shallow and fickle
          Goddess, Cygnus captures the imagination of many in the brothels and
          courtesan houses of the world.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Delphinus</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The God of Joy, Laughter and Frivolity, Delphinus is the God who never
          takes himself too seriously. Delphinus once entertained Mensa for six
          millenia whilst Lacerta made her escape across the sky. Depicted as a
          dolphin in the night sky, Delphinus is the God that storytellers,
          jesters, bards and jongleurs tend to worship. Mostly a peaceful and
          harmless God, rare are the followers of Delphinus who will go to war.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Eridanus</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Eridanus, the depiction of a single coin, God of Trade and Wealth.
          Eridanus brokers deals between all parties, always advocating trade
          over war, finance over violence. Eridanus made the final bargain
          between Andromeda and Vela, the Dawnstar and the Evenstar being split
          between them in the creation of the Cosmos itself. Eridanus is
          followed by merchants and diplomats, and his Coin is the mark of
          Merchants throughout the world.

      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Fornax</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          God of metalworking and forging, Fornax is the hammer that Indus
          wields in the forging of the worlds. Depicting a blacksmith’s hammer
          within the sky, Fornax is a God of unwavering willpower and
          determination. Those that follow Fornax are often smiths or others who
          work in creation industries requiring determination, patience and the
          ability to see the end goal long before the repetition creates the
          result. Fornax is not a God for the weak-hearted.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Indus</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Indus is the God of Creation and Industry. Patron of crafters,
          especially sculptors, Indus is he who forges, creates and builds.
          Often followed by Masons, Builders and Carpenters. Indus forged the
          worlds upon which life was built, and is seen as a determined God of
          Vision and Persistence.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Lacerta</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Lacerta is the Goddess of Death and the Afterlife. Known sometimes as
          the Lizard, the constellation depicts the shedding of ones’ old skin
          as they progress on to the next life on the Wheel. Lacerta is always
          depicted as a veiled woman, her face known only to those who have been
          welcomed into her arms. Fair yet cold, she is the mistress of the
          Fugue Plane and is known to respect life and is in no rush to welcome
          others into her arms, for we all come to Lacerta in the end.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Lyra</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Lyre in the Sky, Lyra played music to Indus as he forged the
          worlds, keeping him inspired and energised. Now she plays for joy and
          for love, always adjacent to Delphinus revelling in love and laughter.
          She is depicted as a pretty, vivacious female with flaxen hair and
          brilliant blue eyes and is always seen carrying her lyre.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Mensa</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          In the shape of a Key, Mensa represents Magic and the understanding of
          magic. Mensa is the father of all magic, controller of the weave and
          Power Incarnate. He works the weave endlessly and is at the heart of
          all spells. Although ostensibly kind and generous, Mensa has become so
          entwined with the weave of magic that he appears inhuman and
          incomprehensible. He weaves his way through the sky providing magic to
          the other Gods.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Musca</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Musca, God of Strength, Resilience and Determination, is often
          depicted as a man with the head of a bull. He is merciless and
          unwavering in his determination, but neither aggressive nor violent.
          He stands as Protector to Cygnus, a sworn protector and loyal servant.

      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Desperately in love with Cygnus, Norma created the bounty of fruit and
          flower upon all the worlds as a gift to her to show his affections.
          Norma is depicted as the Oxen pulling the Plough, and is tireless in
          his work, tracking the marks of his love to Cygnus throughout the sky.

      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Orion</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Huntsman has slain many beasts, laying each at the feet of Vela in
          his endless devotion. Often depicted with Canus at his side, the
          Huntsman is the bounty-bringer, the survivor, the representation of
          independence and self-sufficiency. Orion is often prayed to by those
          tracking a prey, seeking vengeance or tracking criminals but in truth
          the Huntsman is a gentle soul who seeks to reinforce the circle of
          Life.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Perseus</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Gladius and shield in hand, Perseus stands mighty in the sky at night.
          A favourite of soldiers, generals and warmongers in general, Perseus
          is martial in his depiction for a reason. Always first to be called
          upon when the Gods have disagreements, the God of War is a fierce and
          incomparable warrior who is as renowned for his tactical genius as his
          martial prowess.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Sebastian</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          God of Protection and Abjuration, followers of Sebastian are often
          also involved in experimentation and pushing the boundaries of magic.
          Once a hero in Beldania, Sebastian ascended to Godhood with old magic,
          and subsequently has a small following all over the world. Depicted as
          a cat’s eye in the night sky, nobody is quite sure of the connection
          between the cat’s eye and Protection, though legend says the mortal
          may have had some connection with cats.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Serpens</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          God of Lies, Deception and Mischief, Serpens fits his serpentine
          depiction in the sky. Gaining his position in the Pantheon by
          deceiving Andromeda that she had placed him there herself, he is the
          master of trickery and subterfuge. Once able to trick Mensa into
          adjusting the weave to allow him the power to hide the truth from all
          in the Pantheon, Serpens is never trusted but is well respected.
          Patron of thieves, tricksters and frauds, Serpens is not a popular
          God.

        <p>
          God of Learning, Understanding and Knowledge, the great scholar of the
          sky is depicted as a quill in the sky. Tucana has spent countless
          millennia writing the meaning of the universe to Cygnus in his endless
          competition with Norma for her hand. Tucana is the patron of teachers,
          scholars and students alike. Tucana helped Mensa to study the Weave
          and take it within his arms, and thus remains near him for eternity to
          continue his learning.

        <p>
          Ursa, Earth God and Bear, is a stoic protector of simplicity. Known as
          a God of few words, who reveals little, Ursa spent millenia being
          chased through the sky by Canis until he reached his final resting
          place, resting in hibernation until he is called on again to have the
          worlds placed upon his shoulders. Known as the Carrier of Worlds,
          Representation of Earth itself, the stone-shaper, Ursa slumbers until

        <p>
          Eternally beautiful, Vela is the Goddess of Life. Wife to Orion, Vela
          is the gentlest of souls within the sky. She is the bringer of life,
          and the guardian of vitality and sprint. Often depicted carrying a
          child or frolicking through fields of flowers, in the night sky we can
          only see the hands of Vela. She is the provider, the hand of growth
          and the Earth Mother.

      <h3>The Great Dragons</h3>
      <p>
        The Great Dragons are said to once have been dragons who have ascended
        to the Pantheon through their great deeds and learning of magic. This
        worship is mostly by Dragons themselves, though Dragonborn and Kobolds
        often follow the Draconic Pantheon.

      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Bahzurask was known in life as the Flying Flame. He truly believed
          that his destiny was to rule over all dragonkind and lead them in the
          extermination of humans and elves. However, on his path to dominion,
          he had to destroy all who opposed him; he killed so many other dragons
          that elves nicknamed him Dragonsbane.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite his ego, Bahzurask was not stupid in the least, and he would
          escape from a losing battle in order to have vengeance another day.
          His three main talents were that he never forgot the face, name, or
          attitude of any being that he met; he was a good judge of character
          (and not limited only to dragons); and he always calculated the
          consequences and outcomes of his acts.

          the range of peaks in the High Forest of the North.He was famous for

          Druid Dragon and the Wyrm of Golden Hue, was a neutral gold dragon who
          inhabited Tall Trees, in human form, as a Druid. Aerosclughpalar was
          tasked by his king to protect the Tall Trees area of the High Forest,
          but despite fighting off invaders and fires, the forest became

          very lonely being and her main aspiration was to finally fly again in
          the blue sky. She was cynical of people that promised to help her, as
          she had seen too many fail in her long existence. In life, Miirym
          loved green growing things and enjoyed jokes. Her sanity was not
          strong, however, and if someone tried to trick or ambush her she

          avoided other dragons, not out of fear but in order to avoid being
          discovered as twins. Adventurers, on the other hand, they viewed as
          tools too useful to be killed and the Black Brothers needed to recover
          too many artifacts to not use adventurers that agreed to work for
          them.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Olothontor</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Olothontor was an unusual blue dragon who wanted to find a female blue
          dragon mate who could sing (a nearly impossible task), heard the music
          of all the finest minstrels in the world, and collected items and
          spells that helped in his project. Often, he tried to approach song
          dragons but always without results because Olothontor's personality
          always repelled those good-oriented dragons. Since his passing, many
          dragonkind, especially the human descendants, have worshipped
          Olothontor as the God of Romance and Music.
