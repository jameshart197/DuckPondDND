      <p>
        Whilst there are orcs, goblinkind, drow, duergar and some other races in
        the world who are most definitely civilized races, they are also
        inherently evil. As well list the werefolk, demons and other evil beings
        that dwell in Mazrea. As such, only races of mostly goodly weal, or at
        least those that dwell in the cities of traditional civilization, have
        been listed here.

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Aarakocra are spread throughout the world of Mazrea, though they are
          most commonly found in the Eyries of the Northlands and Kelaan.
          Aarakocra tend to be insular and isolationist, and are rarely
          interested in taking positions of authority outside of their
          homelands. Even within their communities, Aarakocra tend to be
          solitary in nature, often ranging far and wide alone. Most Aarakocra
          worship Aquila, a member of the Constellation.

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Once thought to be the descendants of celestials, Aasimar are renowned
          for their beauty and their ability to manifest wings. These days,
          however, most Aasimar are known to be fierce traders of old bloodlines
          and often good wealth. The Aasimar often find themselves as highly
          prized courtesans, concubines and husbands or wives of the rich when
          their bloodlines do not grant them automatic access to the nobility.
          They can often be arrogant and self-righteous, and are very firm in
          their beliefs. Aasimar are often devoutly religious, unwavering in
          their faith and doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Various Aasimar are found ruling throughout the Archipelago.
          Significant Aasimar populations can be found in South-Western Gallania
          and North-Western Kelaan. They often make powerful Sorcerers and
          Clerics, and no matter the path in life they choose, they’re
          ambitious, determined, and relentless in their pursuit for power and
          knowledge.

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Bugbears are an unassuming, peaceful race for the most part with roots
          in the Feywild. Often preferring lives as travelling alchemists,
          huntsmen and the like, many bugbears prefer a solitary lifestyle.
          Nonetheless, due to their stature and natural martial abilities, it is
          not rare to find bugbears as soldiers and guards in the employ of the
          rich and wealthy. There are many Bugbears throughout Kelaan, though
          they often prefer solitary roles within small villages.

            >Centaurs on DNDBeyond</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The Centaur Herds roam the hills and plains of Gallania, always on the
          move. They go to the Hunt weekly and all centaurs that are able
          participate as the Herd hunts Elk, Wyverns, anything that is swift and
          a challenge. The Rite of the Hunt is sacred to them, and even Centaurs
          that venture elsewhere in the world will often feel the call to the
          Hunt. The Centaur are a deeply reflective folk, and they worship the
          stars and constellations. Most Centaurs are deeply prideful and will
          brook no insults to themselves or their people, calling any such
          person who would throw insults to the Draw, a duel sacred in the
          Centaur culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Centaurs are very tribal and tend to dismiss other races as
          insignificant, their traditions bind them, but also keep them a little
          rural in comparison to many other races; Centaurs live on the move,
          and rarely stop in cities or towns, they trade little and they live a
          nomadic life. They tend to be very strong of arm, and have little
          tolerance for the old, weak or sickly. Centaurs come of age as young
          as 12, and live for many centuries.

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Changelings are often regarded with distrust and fear due to their
          abilities to emulate others, nevertheless, they are often the most
          well paid of spies, assassins and thieves. Due to their unique
          abilities, changelings often found themselves desired either for
          criminal activity or as concubines or courtesans; those who do manage
          to find a life outside of these constraints often do so as actors,
          entertainers or by remaining in one persona for their entire public
          life. It is impossible to place an estimate on Changeling numbers, due
          to their nature, though there are many living throughout the
          Archipelago and Kelaan. Few Changelings take positions of power,
          though they are often found high up in the hierarchies of those in
          power.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Dragonborn</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/16-dragonborn"
            target="_blank"
            >Dragonborn on DNDBeyond</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The Dragonborn in the world of Mazrea are a diverse and spread out
          folk. Primarily worshipping the three Dragon Gods and the souls of
          Dragons past, these creatures came into being from prolonged proximity
          to Dragons over the ages. They tend to resemble the Dragons that made
          them both in terms of their dispositions and their features. The
          Golden Dragonborns were the first, as Golden Dragons tend to be the
          most gentle and benevolent. Golden Dragonborns are the Ruling Caste of
          the Dragonborn culture worldwide, and all Golden Dragonborns worldwide
          will be greatly respected and are the very top of the Dragonborn
          Hierarchy. The Silver Dragonborns came second and have always acted as
          Shield-Brothers to their Golden Kin, their right-hand-men so to speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bronze Dragonborn have always been the caretakers of Dragons and are
          respected by both chromatic and metallic dragonborn for the work they
          have done. They have created cities within the great deserts of
          Gallania that Dragons can walk freely within and feel at home in, they
          are known for their Dragonsingers, bards of great renown who sing the
          praises and beauties of Dragons, appeasing the vain creatures. They
          are also known to be expert Dragon Groomers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brass and Copper Dragonborn have at various times held different roles
          within the Dragonborn community, be that the roles of assisting in
          caring for Dragons, or latter as expert craftsmen and tradespeople;
          Brass and Copper Dragonborns have always been the “middle class” of
          Dragonborn Culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traditionally, Chromatic Dragons were evil; though many have since
          been quelled by their metallic kin, or at least kept somewhat under
          control. The same, however, is not true for the Chromatic Dragonborn
          that they once created. Historically, Chromatic Dragonborn were the
          Dragon-Riders, who rode upon dragons creating havoc and terror
          wherever they went. That is, however, ancient history. Nowadays the
          Chromatic Dragons are the lesser caste; they are mostly the serfs,
          farmers, servants and lesserfolk of the Dragonborn culture, however
          there are some exceptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Black Dragonborn are typically the most magically gifted of all
          Dragonborn, and those who are tend to be quite well regarded within
          the Dragonborn communities. Red Dragonborn tend to be the best of
          craftsmen when it comes to Blacksmithing and Metal-Working. White and
          Blue Dragonborn tend to unanimously be slaves, serfs, servants and
          smallfolk. Green Dragonborn are almost all slaves or criminals.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Dryad</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/2716-dryad" target="_blank"
            >Dryads on DNDBeyond</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The Dryads can be found in forests all over the world of Mazrea. They
          tend to keep to the quieter and more mysterious and magical forests,
          such as the Glurvyndale. The Dryads tend to keep themselves to
          themselves and only really the Elves get to see this elusive race on a
          regular basis. Living within trees and bound to a tree spirit
          themselves, rare is it that a Dryad would venture from the forest.
          However, it does happen on occasion; there was one traveling dryad who
          carried a small sapling of her soul tree with her as she traveled the
          world teaching of the strange herbs and plants she had discovered and
          of alchemical wonders.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Dryads tend to be very protective of each other, and outside of
          mating season will rarely be seen. During mating season however, when
          the Dryads are looking for partners, they can be incredibly
          enthusiastic when male visitors come to their forests. A Dryad in the
          midsummer’s heat can be positively dangerous!

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Dwarf</button>

          <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/13-dwarf" target="_blank"
            >Dwarves on DNDBeyond</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Dwarves are a very clannish group, and although they are scattered
          throughout Mazrea, they are always loyal to one another. There are
          dwarfhomes throughout Beldania and Kelaan, and they seem to have a way
          of remaining in contact with each other. The original dwarfhome, or at
          least, the seat of Dwarven Royalty is Ellodar in Beldania. King Igor
          Ironbeard currently holds the throne in Ellodar; almost all dwarves
          will, at some point in their lives, make the trip to Ellodar to see
          the true home of the Dwarves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dwarves tend to be a solitary group, not particularly welcoming of
          outsiders, though never truly turning anyone in need from their
          doorsteps. They are notoriously racist however, and will always value
          the lives of Dwarves above any others. They tend to stick to their
          large underground cities, though some dwarves have chosen to venture
          forth from these citadels to visit the wider world. One notable
          Dwarven Clan is the Greenbeards, who live above ground in the forests
          of Weylynd, where they all dye their beards green and worship the
          forest gods.

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Eladrin are beautiful and deeply magical Elves that tend to reside in
          places of incredible natural beauty. Very careful in their avoidance
          of cities, most are sorcerers and wizards who keep to themselves and
          have their own business to mind, or small families travelling quietly
          within ancient forests and glades. When Eladrin do interact with
          others in the world, it is often in places of worship or study, such
          as the Academy of Shar, the University of Vazra and various temples.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Elf</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/3-elf" target="_blank"
            >Elves on DNDBeyond</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The Elves are split into three categories, the Sun Elves, the High
          Elves and the Wood Elves;
        </p>
        <h3>Sun Elf</h3>
        <p>
          The Sun Elves are typical forest-based Elves who live in their own
          cities within the trees. What delineates them from the Wood Elves is
          the fact they can draw magic from the forests themselves, both to
          protect them and to protect their people. Fool is the man who attacks
          a Sun Elf in their own dwelling. Sun Elves tend to be distrustful of
          those outside their borders, though they are always willing to help
          those in need. They dwell mostly within the Glurvyndale, though there
          are a fair few in Vuralian forests as well.
        </p>
        <h3>High Elf (City Elf)</h3>
        <p>
          The High Elves are aristocratic elves that have moved out of the
          forests and into the cities. They are often the high nobility within a
          city, though a second strand of these High Elves prefer the simplistic
          life of village folk and have moved out to the smaller villages to
          pursue lives where creativity and beauty rule; these people are often
          tradesfolk such as potters and painters. The City Elves, as the High
          Elves have come to be known, tend more to the noble lifestyles,
          throwing lavish balls, playing the games of intrigue and romance at
          court, and vying to be seen as important.
        </p>
        <h3>Wood Elf</h3>
        <p>
          The Wood Elves describe themselves as those closest to the earth of
          the Elven Clans. The Wood Elves live exclusively within the forests of
          Vuralia and the Glurvyndale, and will rarely venture from those lands.
          They are the protectors of those woods, and they live in harmony with
          all of the nature within the woods. The Wood Elves tend to be
          exceptional archers, deadly with a sword, and exquisitely beautiful.
          They spend a lot of their time singing and dancing within the forests,
          and live a generally carefree life.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Fairy</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">

            >Fairies on DNDBeyond</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The Fairies tend to live in places of natural beauty, be these
          waterfalls, lakes, forests or otherworldly caverns. These small
          creatures tend to be solitary from the age of 9 or 10. They mature
          quickly although never truly maturing, and tend to be very nature
          based. Some small few have entered cities and the aristocracy but they
          are few and far between. Usually a playful group that worship gods of
          laughter, joy, natural beauty and mischief, they are a gentle folk.
          They have no singular place of origin and tend not to have larger
          communities but instead smaller families dotted around. Most Fairies
          have inherent magic that they use to protect themselves despite their
          smaller stature, as most fairies stand between 3 and 4 feet tall. The
          nature of this magic, however, is usually the ability to hide and stay
          unnoticed when the larger folk come by.

            >Firbolgs on DNDBeyond</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The Firbolgs are the gentle giants of the world. They tend to live at
          the foothills of mountains, and around the edges of forests, and are
          often regarded as protectors of the land itself. They tend towards the
          druidic arts and can almost always be found alone or in simple
          families of three. Firbolgs live longer lives than most humanoid
          races, and tend to live most of those lives in the same place;
          therefore if you find a Firbolg in his natural homeland, he will
          always be the most knowledgeable person about the local land. Firbolgs
          have a natural racial inclination to distrust Goliaths, as in their
          mythology, their Gods are continually at war. Firbolgs are not a
          warlike folk however, and are for the most part gentle and simple
          beings. Firbolg rarely mate for life, instead coming together to
          create offspring and raise it, and then moving apart again, as their
          first love is always for the land in which they live.

        <p>
          Firenewts are a tribal folk that rose from the Throat of Nessus in the
          Archipelago approximately a century ago. There was a violent and
          tumultuous disagreement between two factions of the Firenewts, one
          faction remaining in the Ebony Peaks, and the other travelling until
          they found their homes in the fiery deserts of the Savage Lands, in
          the far North West of Gallania. Firenewts are often savage, aggressive
          and quick to violence and as such, they remain within their small
          tribes. Whilst it is uncommon, some few travellers have visited the
          Firenewts peacefully, and tell tales of their strong pyromancers and
          deep connection with the land.

          and countless other subjects. Flumphs are sensitive to the emotional
          states of nearby creatures. If a creature's thoughts suggest goodness,
          a flumph seeks that creature out. When facing creatures that exude
          evil, a flumph flees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flumphs are often foundin the Underdark, and those who do live above
          land tend towards small, squat homes that allow in little light.
          Flumphs are often found at study in the University of Vazra or the
          Academy of Shar, and many Flumphs are strong mages of various forms.
          Following their studies, Flumphs tend to lead a nomadic lifestyle, and
          can be found all across Mazrea, though they avoid the colder lands.

      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Genasi Homeland is in Beldania, in the land of Urlana. Since their
          coming to be, however, Genasi have spread across the whole world, and
          are second only to humans in their diversity and their variety of
          homeplaces. The Homeland was created during the collision of two
          Primordial beings, one of Water and one of Earth. To this day, the
          Genasi worship the Primordials as Gods, and as such have a very
          naturalistic essence at the core of their being. A water Genasi, for
          example, may for most of their lives operate as one of the aristocracy
          in a city, but will still retain a part of themselves that is truly
          elemental.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Genasi have a tendency to marry within their chosen element,
          though it is possible for a Fire and Earth Genasi, for example, to
          breed. Should this occur, it is up to the twists of fate which element
          the child shall be born closest to. The Genasi Homeland is a place of
          primal nature, with cascading waterfalls, volcanic explosions,
          constant earthquakes and terrifying winds, nevertheless, all Genasi,
          regardless of where they reside, regard this as home.
        </p>
        <h3>Air Genasi</h3>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/1026379-air-genasi"
            target="_blank"
            >Air Genasi on DNDBeyond</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Air Genasi tend to be flighty and temperamental, often chasing their
          dreams and leaning towards the more creative arts. Many Air Genasi
          travel, which in turn is a little unusual for Genasi as a whole, as
          they often find a home that feels elementally in tune with them and
          settle down. Air Genasi can often be quick to laugh and quick to
          anger, and rarely hold a grudge or stick to one thing for any long
          period of time. They are widespread throughout Mazrea, though it is
          worth mentioning that beyond the Homeland there is also a large
          collection of Air Genasi in the Storm King’s Citadel in the
          Archipelago, where the Storm King is an Air Genasi.
        </p>
        <h3>Earth Genasi</h3>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/1026385-earth-genasi"
            target="_blank"
            >Earth Genasi on DNDBeyond</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Earth Genasi tend to be stoic, determined and slow to rouse, though
          when they do express their emotions it tends to be a strong and
          prolonged release. Often gruff and deep-voiced, Earth Genasi are the
          least travelled of the Genasi, and the most populous within the
          Homeland. They do not tend to be ambitious, and rarely push for roles
          of authority or leadership, though they are steady custodians when
          handed the reins of power. Many Earth Genasi find roles or jobs in
          life that are close to the earth and ground they feel at home in,
          whether working in mines and caves, or with the shaping of the stone,
          or simply surrounded by nature. Earth Genasi tend to be rocky and
          craggy in features, their skin rough and stonelike, their hair often
          grown in dreadlocks or thick manes.
        </p>
        <h3>Fire Genasi</h3>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/1026388-fire-genasi"

            >Fire Genasi on DNDBeyond</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Fire Genasi tend to be exactly what you would expect, typically fiery,
          passionate and emotionally driven. By far the most well-travelled of
          the genasi, and found all over the world, fire genasi tend to follow
          their hearts with little consideration for much else, and are often
          considered rash and reckless. Fire Genasi are a magical folk, and many
          of them have innate magical powers, which they may or may not further
          during study or practice. Fire Genasi are often ambitious and
          power-hungry, though once they attain power they tend not to hold onto
          it for very long, or seek further power.
        </p>
        <h3>Water Genasi</h3>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/1026406-water-genasi"

            >Water Genasi on DNDBeyond</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Usually peaceful and meditative in nature, Water Genasi are a gentle
          folk for the most part, with a calm rationale and a reflective
          temperament. Water Genasi are found throughout Mazrea, and many that
          choose to travel do so for religious purposes, feeling the call to
          share their religion and calling elsewhere. Water Genasi are often
          powerful Clerics or Druids, their innate magic lending well to their
          studies. Water Genasi often hold high positions in temples or
          clergies, but rarely within politics, usually choosing to stay out of
          such matters. Most Water Genasi make their homes close to the water or
          on it, and it's very common to find sailors and captains at sea that
          are Water Genasi.

        </p>
        <p>
          Gnomes are spread throughout the world, and can vary greatly in their
          nature; nevertheless there is one trait that can link them all
          together, and that is curiosity. Gnomes are often found as students of
          the various arts, be they magical or scientific. They are a people who
          love to create, and to build, and the cities within the countries that
          gnomes rule tend to be incredibly complicated and magnificent to
          behold (though not always particularly organised!). The Forest Gnomes
          tend towards a more peaceful life, and are usually found dwelling on
          the edges of more magical forests. The Rock Gnomes tend towards the
          crystalline groves at the foothills of mountains, and tend to be more
          of the magical arts. The Deep Gnomes tend towards the Underdark and
          live further from the rest of society than other gnomes. Less is known
          about these gnomes, for they venture rarely to the surface, but it is
          said they are the most incredible of builders, and have a symbiotic
          relationship with the Earth.

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Goliaths are native to the Gaerik Northlands, and they thrive in this
          harsh bitter land of thin air and frigid winds. They wander this bleak
          realm of wind, cold and mountain, and their bodies resemble the harsh
          lands in which they live. They tend to have very deep voices that
          rumble like the mountains themselves, and their skin is hardened to be
          almost rock-like. They prefer the colder climates and those that have
          left the Northlands have found it difficult to adjust to the
          temperature changes. The Goliath Tribes attribute themselves to a
          certain animal, much like their Firbolg cousins and rivals.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Cosmos, Goliath and Firbolg Gods are constantly at war, however
          both follow many of the same beliefs, are both protectors of the land
          on which they live, and live a life that remains very close to the
          land and earth. The Goliath Tribes tend to move with the Caribou which
          they hunt and eat, and each tribe resembles their totem animal in one
          way or another. Goliaths are always competing, be it with each other,
          themselves, or the wilderness in which they live. Their competitions
          are sacred to them, and winners of these competitions are remembered
          for years after their successes. The Goliaths have a strict code of
          honor and trust, and lying is a completely foreign concept to them.

        <p>
          There are two types of Grung, the Smallfolk who originate in Chimvaya,
          and the Tallfolk which are tribal hunters on the islands of the
          Archipelago. Grung are superstitious folk who believe in portents and
          omens, and much of their lifestyle reflects this. Rare is the Grung
          found outside his tribe, although those that travel tend to do so for
          religious reasons. Most Grung, even the Smallfolk from Chimvaya,
          follow the Aspects of the Moons.

          Hadozee are primarily found in the southern islands of the
          Archipelago; in fact almost the entire population of Hadozee in Mazrea
          can be found in the Cartara Wilds. Hadozee are a curious folk, who are
          timid and peaceful in nature, and are very welcoming of travellers.
          Hadozee tend to be distrustful of magic, unless it is the natural
          magics of the forests of Endreach. They mostly live in trees, or small
          houses built within trees. Hadozee are not a very fecund folk, and
          many families do not have children, making a Hadozee child a precious
          and well protected creature. This is the main reason Hadozee are rare
          elsewhere in the world, there are few of them, and they are reluctant
          to leave the protection of their forests.

        <p>
          A blend of the long-lived Elves and the shorter, hastier humankind,
          Half-Elves bring traits of both. Belonging fully to neither race,
          Half-Elves often resemble most the parent that brought them up, though
          often feel like outcasts and misfits with peers of either race. Many
          Half-Elves wander the world lonely, or settle into society as quieter
          folk. Each Half-Elf is different depending on which group of Elves and
          Humans they were born to.

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The Half-Orcs are, as far we know, unique to Yaervul, a small area of
          West Gallania. A long distant ancestry of when Orcs and Humans
          mingled, they share racial traits of both races, though they tend not
          to interbreed with any true Humans or Orcs anymore. A deeply
          traditional folk, whose larger and more grotesque faces hide a gentle
          people who are contemplative, reflective and generous of spirit. The
          Half-Orcs have shunned the Gods of the Orcs and Humans alike, instead
          preferring to worship the spirits of the land around them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deeply entwined with the nature of the land of Yaervul, most Half-Orcs
          have a sense of the world around them in the Desert lands that they
          would be hard pressed to explain to an outsider; somewhere between
          heat sense and tremorsense. They are astute within the deserts but
          would be mostly lost outside of them. Yaervul has become as
          distrustful of outsiders as people have been historically of the
          Half-Orcs. They follow a strict Hierarchy of age, and the Elders of
          the community are deeply respected.

        </p>
        <p>
          The Halflings are a widespread folk, who can be divided into their
          nine clans; The Boulderdowns, Burrows, Goldenshires, Safeton and
          Weylynd Clans are all based in certain places in the world, and tend
          to remain in these places for generations on end. These Halflings tend
          to be gentle folk, who live simple and peaceful lives; often artisans
          or masters of their craft, even if that craft be as simple as farming.
          There is then the Myrwater Clan, the Royal Clan of Cormyn, who also
          have members in Weylynd in Kelaan where they rule there too. The
          Myrwaters are a kind and generous clan, though are a lot less humble
          and more self-confident than most other Halflings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most adventurous of Halflings are the Swiftfoot Clan, who venture
          all over the world, usually as bards, tricksters and thieves, and will
          go from place to place telling tales of their travels and
          investigating new lands. The Swiftfoot Clan members rarely stay in one
          place for more than a few years before moving on to see the wider
          world. Much akin to the Swiftfoot Clan are those of the Grinning
          Ponies; the Grinning Ponies are a group who spend their whole lives
          raising and breeding Ponies, and traveling upon said ponies to find
          new places and explore. Much like their Swiftfoot Brothers, Grinning
          Ponies Halflings rarely stay in one place for a long period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Raezon Halflings are the final clan of halflings, and by far the most
          unusual. This group of Halflings tend towards the more mystic or
          Divine arts, and are often found to be sorcerers, wizards and priests.
          They spend the majority of the lives in study or in devotion, and will
          often leave their homeland to travel miles across the world to a place
          that they feel is more natural to their studies and desires.

        <p>
          Humans are all over the world, and are as varied as any race can be.
          Humans have been capable of the most heinous of evil crimes and the
          greatest of noble deeds; they are one of the few races that tolerate
          poverty, and allow members of their own race to starve and go homeless
          within their vast cities. Humans have managed to spread through most
          of the more temperate countries of Mazrea, though they have struggled
          to gain any foothold on the lands of Gallania.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Human cities are multicultural and diverse, as most humans are
          very open-minded and accepting of others, despite the way they isolate
          members of their own communities. Their cities are led by nobility and
          bloodline is often an important factor in the fate of a human. It can
          be impossible to judge the nature of any human by their race alone;
          they follow many Gods, many traditions and varied beliefs depending on
          where in the world they are born, their class, stature and wealth.

        </p>
        <p>
          The Kalashtari originated in South East Kelaan, but nowadays they
          travel freely across all of the world, for they are naturally
          explorers and wanderers at heart. Part of this is because of their
          nature, but for the most part this is because at the age of 20, when a
          Kalashtar comes of age, they go to seek out a place of natural
          affinity to renew their bond with the spirit that they are bound to
          from birth. Kalashtari are bound to prime elemental spirits when they
          are first born; these can be as simple as Earth, Fire and Air spirits,
          or as complex as Decay, Grazeland, Desert and Waterfall spirits. Each
          of these spirits has its’ own nature, and though these spirits do not
          talk, they can communicate feelings. This can lead to Kalashtari
          taking on certain personality traits from their spirits. A Kalshatar
          bound to an Earth Spirit for example may be a patient and gentle
          person, slow to anger; quite the opposite may be true of one bound to
          a Fire Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kalashtar tend to stop wandering when they are due to have a child,
          and settle down for twenty years or so, before continuing on their
          travels when their offspring makes their spirit journey to renew their
          affinity with their spirit. Just because parents have a certain nature
          of spiritual bond (perhaps they are both bound to water spirits) it
          does not mean that their children will also have a similar nature.
          Most Kalashtar find themselves adventuring across the land sooner or
          later as the wandering urges from their natural spirit companions
          press on them to do so. A few, however, settle in a place natural to
          the spirit they are bound with, and remain there for the rest of their
          years.

          Kalashtar are usually a little taller than your average humanoid,
          usually between 5”8 and 7 feet tall. They tend to be thin and willowy
          in nature. They tend to live approximately 120-140 years, and when
          they die, someone must take the spirit that they were bound to to a
          place that is natural to them to lay it to rest so it may return to
          the wilds and bind once again to a Kalashtar in the future.

        <p>
          The Kender are magical folk with supernatural curiosity and a fearless
          tendency to explore. They often enjoy collecting strange objects from
          their travels and are often explorers, adventurers and archaeologists.
          Due to their natural inquisitiveness, Kender are often found near
          ruins, dungeons, and places of magical mystery. Kender are found
          throughout the world of Mazrea, and do not keep their intimate
          relationships to members of their own race, meaning that there are
          many half-Kender of different varieties across the world.

        <p>
          The Kenku are unusual in Mazrea in that they tend to all be members of
          the same tribe. Living in the cold, harsh Gaerik Northlands on the
          South West of the Island, the Kenku are deeply entwined with their
          worship of the Raven Queen. Much like the Raven Queen, they are a
          little unusual, and some might say unhinged. Most Kenku worship
          madness and chaos, and enjoy strange games of intrigue and corruption
          of the mind. They partake in strong narcotics and alcohols and
          regularly fraternize with members of the Spirit Realms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kenku are unable to fly, a curse from their Raven Queen, but they are
          an incredibly tough and robust race that survive in a land most would
          struggle within. There is little trade between them and the other folk
          of the Gaerik Northlands, but some Kenku have been called by the Raven
          Queen to spread word of her and have left the Gaerik Northlands on a
          Pilgrimage to other parts of the world.

          The Kobolds have been entirely enslaved by the Gnomes. The majority of
          Kobolds live in Vorzania under the tight control of the Gnomes, though
          there are a few who have escaped to freedom within the boundaries of
          Peweston and the Glurvyndale where slavery is not tolerated. The
          Kobolds believe in the mighty Dragon Gods, and hope that one day their
          Gods will come down to rain the elements upon the gnomes and free the
          Kobolds forevermore. There are also Kobolds enslaved underground by
          the Deep Gnomes and by the Drow. It is incredibly rare to see a free
          Kobold, and in the lands of the Gnomes they are treated as a
          necessity. Obedient and educated slaves are well valued within the
          Gnome lands, so they do their best to ensure their slaves are happy
          and well taught, but slavery is never pleasant.

        <p>
          The Leonin are a proud and diverse race, primarily based in Haellian
          in Beldania, though some few have traveled around Mazrea to other
          areas. They are a deeply spiritual folk who follow the stars and
          worship the constellations. Leonin divide themselves into various
          Prides, who are usually made up of 12-16 Leonin, though some groups
          are smaller or larger. The Leonin believe in strength of arm, skill at
          the hunt and have an intensely complicated code of honor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Leonin are nomadic, though there are areas in which certain
          Prides reside and have done so for many years. Leonin are territorial,
          and it is customary to send word ahead of a visit. They distrust
          magic, and all things magical, and pay homage to various monuments
          within Haellian. Water is a sacred resource to the Prides of the
          Leonin, and to fight near water is to incur the wrath of all Leonin
          and their Gods, or so it is believed. Water, and Desert Oases, are
          sacred and peaceful places where the Prides can gather to share tales
          and find partners.

        <p>
          The Lizardfolk are a race who seem to rush to complete as much as they
          can in their shorter lifespans than any other race. They are deeply
          ambitious, and apply this to whatever their trade is at the time. Most
          Lizardfolk see politics as a means to power and accomplishment, though
          Lizardfolk worldwide have been seen applying this ambition to all
          manners of trades and lifestyles. They are a hardy folk, and thrive in
          varied environments, from jungle to deserts. Jungle Lizardfolk are
          renowned for the narcotics that they both grow and trade, the Yuan-ti
          are especially fond of these narcotics and in areas of jungle you can
          almost always find lizardfolk and Yuan-ti living side by side.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lizardfolk are often quick to violence, much as they are quick to
          any other action within their lives. Most lizardfolk seem to try to
          sleep as little as possible, do as much as they can within their days,
          and repeat this the following day.

          are in very different places throughout Mazrea. Loxodon are incredibly
          loyal to each other and to their ancestry, and each tribe keeps
          incredibly detailed histories of their ancestry. They can be found in
          the Gaerik Northlands, the extreme West in Gallania and in South-East
          Kelaan. Rare is the Loxodon who leaves their tribe, though it has been
          known to have happened. Loxodon tribes are Matriarchal, and they tend
          to defer to their female compatriots at all times. Loxodon stand
          between 7 and 8 foot tall for the most part, are exceptionally heavy
          and live for 4 or 5 centuries.

          Most minotaurs revel in jewellery and treasure and have a primal
          desire to collect beauty. Minotaurs are mostly found in the richer
          cities of the Archipelagos, on boats upon the Sea of Rogues or in the
          grand cities of Kelaan.

        <p>
          A peaceful folk from the land of Chimvaya, Mousefolk spend much of
          their days eating and sleeping. They tend to have extremely large
          families and value bloodlines and family over all else. Usually found
          fairly close to the World Tree, they see themselves as the protectors
          of the tree, and spend the vast majority of their time caring for the
          tree and polishing it up and down its mighty limbs. The Mousefolk
          stand between 1 and 3 foot tall, and are divided into the Meadow folk,
          who live at the bottom of the tree, and the Softpaws, who make their
          homes within the World Tree itself. Mousefolk tend to be resourceful
          and tenacious, and they believe in community over all else. The
          patterns of their fur dictate their hereditary history and family
          bloodlines and thus they keep incredibly good care of their fur. They
          are traders, craftsmen and hunters and are as close to a warrior as
          you might find within Chimvaya.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some mousefolk have ventured forth from Chimvaya to Northern Kelaan
          where they have become renowned as chefs and food producers. There’s
          also a fair contingent of mousefolk throughout the Archipelago who

          Naga are snakelike creatures in their demeanour as much as their
          features. Cunning, sly and ambitious, they are often found in small
          tribes in the Savage West of Gallania, or as lone enterprising
          individuals scattered throughout the Archipelago and Kelaan. The naga
          found in cities and towns are often regarded suspiciously and may well
          offer services and products that would not be readily available
          elsewhere. Naga tend to be narcissistic and untrustworthy, though
          there are exceptions. It is very difficult to tell a female and male
          Naga apart.

          The Owlin are a strange and mystic folk who inhabit the trees of
          Chimvaya. They keep mostly to themselves, and believe in the wisdom of
          the collective above all else. Most Owlin spend their lives in study
          and in contemplation, whether that study is of history, the arcane
          arts or the mystic crafts of their people. The Owlin worship the
          Goddess of the Night above all else, and almost all Owlin are
          nocturnal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The plumage of an Owlin develops over time with their age and magics,
          and a multi-coloured Owlin is assumably both aged and powerful in the
          ways of their magics. Owlin are often incredibly protective of their
          secrets and their homes and rarely venture to speak with the other
          races of Chimvaya. Those Owlin who have left Chimvaya have often
          travelled to the Archipelago and beyond, heeding their natural
          curiosity and desire for knowledge. There is also a small contingent
          of Owlin wizards in the Academy of Shar.

          The Satyr tend to be a nomadic race, operating in small clans across
          Mazrea. Satyr can be divided into four groups by the God they worship.
          Those that worship Gaecilia are the gentle forest Satyr, mostly found
          in North-West Kelaan. Those that worship Jurus are those that tend
          towards the more mischievous and criminal lives, though there are also
          many clerics of Jurus who are not criminal at all. There are those
          that worship Borlean and study the arcane arts, or become tradesfolk
          of the more complex type, such as apothecaries and alchemists. Most
          City Satyr worship Borlean. Lastly, there are those that worship Quan.
          The Quan-worshipping Satyr are the nomadic, fun-loving, all singing,
          all dancing Satyrs for which the race is most well known. These Satyr
          can be found wandering between towns and cities, performing on the

        </p>
        <p>
          Shifters are found in the Savage West of Gallania and in Southern
          Kelaan (they were once the defenders of the borders of Zurei when it
          was independent). They are a fierce folk, excellent in battle and well
          known for their fearsome beastly transformations. Despite this,
          however, outside of battle the shifters are mostly a peaceful folk who
          worship the land and their totem animals. Shifters are often on the
          edge of wildness and can be a little chaotic however. The Shifters
          believe in being self-reliant and conjuring inner strength in times of
          need rather than relying on someone else. A common saying for a
          shifter is “preparing for the journey yet to come” which reflects how
          they believe the world changes constantly and it's important to be
          prepared for whatever comes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shifters believe that the reward for this independence is freedom, and
          will always feel uncomfortable around strict authority for these
          reasons; Shifters often don’t meld well into settlements with complex
          law structures. Shifters often change moods in swift and dramatic
          fashion and find it difficult to control their emotions in stressful
          situations. Shifters often take on personality traits of their totem
          animals without meaning to; it is not uncommon to see a shifter snarl
          or growl.

          The Simic Hybrids are limited to only the land of Endreach in the

          up due to a volcano from deep under the sea, tilting the land at an
          angle into the ocean. All those living in the East side of the island
          were lowered far below the ocean due to this catastrophe, but their
          God took pity on them, and the great Aquoris sheltered them with a
          hand. Wherever his hand touched these beings, their previously Sea Elf
          bodies changed forevermore in various different ways creating the
          Simic Hybrid race. They are distrustful of outsiders, very warlike and
          martial in their outlook and stick to old traditions that many others
          would deem savage.

          mountainous and desert lands of Gallania, Beldania and Kelaan. They
          have strict traditions and respect their Elders; following their
          guidance no matter what. Tabaxi often protect almost untouched ruins
          that were once revered by their people within their lands. They stand
          between 5 and 6 foot tall and are incredibly agile. Deep in the South
          in Llornikasia are the Snow Tabaxi. A much untouched wildland within
          the snow, the Tabaxi there have adapted incredibly well. They see few
          outsiders and speak a unique and unusual language. Remarkably,
          however, their traditions and beliefs echo those of the Desert Tabaxi
          in many ways.

          possess six limbs, walking on two legs and possessing four arms, each
          ending in four prehensile, claw-like fingers. The lower two arms are
          smaller and less-powerful than the upper two. Their heads possess
          compound eyes, generally in somewhat-brighter colours like green or
          blue, antennae, and mandibles. Because of the alien shape of their
          jaws, they have difficulty speaking and pronouncing Common and most
          other humanoid languages besides their own.

          With fierce and capable warriors and a small amount of magic, most
          Thri-Kreen tribes are formidable enemies. What is known about them is
          that they have a strict tribe hierarchy, and that this applies across
          all the different tribes of the Tangles. Thri-Kreen have a very rigid
          code of honour that they adhere to even when others might deem it
          madness.

        </p>
        <p>
          Once apparently descended from Devils and Humans conceiving children
          together, nowadays the Tieflings live peacefully within cities
          alongside other races. Tieflings are known to be quick to laughter and
          joy and are often playful and mischievous. Most tieflings have
          red-tinged skin with deep black eyes and horns. There are, however, an
          incredibly wide variety of complexions, horn types and eye colours
          within the Tiefling culture. They are adaptable and resilient to
          hardship, and possess strong aptitude at whatever pursuit they
          dedicate themselves to, whether that be fighting, art, or anything
          else.
        </p>
        <p>
          When facing adversity, the tiefling instinct is not to withdraw from
          the world, but rather to challenge it head-on. Tieflings seek to make
          their own fates, defy the odds, and take risks that even most humans
          would not dare. They are fiercely independent and as such Tieflings
          are known to make intractable slaves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tieflings can be found throughout Mazrea, though are often regarded
          negatively or shunned in Kelaan. Tieflings tend to worship the
          Constellation, though many are drawn specifically to Canis, the God of
          Ambition. Tieflings are often naturally magical and many of them
          pursue the arcane arts as a result.

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The Tortles are a very solitary race, maturing within a few years of
          their birth and setting out traveling around the world. Tortles are
          not a very populous race, but its not unusual to find one wandering
          through the cities and wilderness anywhere in the world of Mazrea.
          They are a long-lived race, often living up to a millenia in age, and
          they tend to be slow to conflict, instead preferring to ponder both
          sides of any given argument. There are almost no Tortles in positions
          of responsibility, most instead preferring to remain as observers
          within the world. Tortles tend towards the more magical and divine
          arts rather than defending themselves with martial abilities.

        </p>
        <p>
          In the Great Archipelago, there is no race more commonly seen than the
          Triton. Existing both on the small islands of the Archipelago and in
          their underwater cities, the island chains are the perfect home for
          this race. The Tritons are a fierce race of individuals well adapted
          to aquatic environments. They are a matriarchal society who have deep
          religious beliefs that they follow faithfully and ardently. Their
          underwater cities are incredibly beautiful to any who are able to
          visit, though they rarely ever let outsiders visit. A proud people
          with many preconceptions as a result of their way of life who believe
          the world owes them due to the evils under the sea that this race
          single-handedly keep at bay. Perhaps they are right.

        </p>
        <p>
          The Vedalken inhabit the cold lands of the Gaerik Northlands, where
          they live in their fortresses beneath the icy tundra, working
          endlessly and tirelessly to create unusual contraptions and make
          breakthroughs in magical discovery. A race who are never content with
          where they are, but instead seek endless improvement and a perfection
          that cannot be achieved, the Vedalken are fiercely intelligent. They
          mature slowly and age very slowly, often living many centuries; they
          resemble the environments they live in in many different ways; their
          skin the pale blue of the icy caverns they live under, moving and
          aging slowly like the frozen tundras above. Ultimately, the Vedalken
          are a group that rarely travel or entertain visitors, though they do
          maintain trade relations with the Loxodon and Goliath tribes near
          their homes. They place intellectual prowess and understanding above
          all else, and this is reflected by the Gods they worship.

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The Yuanti are cold blooded in more ways than one. Found almost
          exclusively within the jungles of Beldania, the Archipelago and
          Kelaan, the Yuanti are a threat to nobody but themselves because of
          their lifestyles. Spending almost the entirety of their existences
          plotting against one another for political and financial gain and
          planning each others’ assassinations, this uncaring and calculated
          race are often so enmeshed in their political agendas that they forget
          anything else matters. Often addicted to various narcotics grown
          within the jungles surrounding them, as many of them use anti-toxins
          to avoid being poisoned as pleasure drugs, it is rare to find a Yuanti
          with a clear mind. Those that do manage to achieve a clear mind for a
          brief period of time often leave the jungles to pursue different lives
          outside of Yuanti politics. Yuanti are fiercely loyal to their
          individual clans and bloodlines.

          These races can be found in Mazrea outside of Chimvaya, but are
          incredibly rare and unusual. Gallus, for example, are limited to a
          very small community of seven or eight families within the Archipelago
          and are unknown anywhere else outside of Chimvaya.
