      <h1 class="world-page-title">Guilds and Factions in Mazrea</h1>
      <p>
        Across the world of Mazrea there are countless guilds and factions
        dedicated to specific pursuits, such as the various guilds of merchants
        across the lands, specific orders dedicated to artisan crafts, or the
        many guilds of adventurers, guards and mercenaries. It should also be
        mentioned that the University of Vazra and the Academy of Shar, whilst
        not factions or guilds themselves, have strong influence
        internationally. That being said, there are a few guilds or factions
        that operate across the entire world. These are as follows;
      </p>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Mages’ guild</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Whilst many of the members of the Mages’ Guild have studied at the
          Academy of Shar, all official members of the Guild no longer have any
          affiliation with the Academy. The Mages’ Guild operates across
          Gallania, Beldania, the Archipelago, the Gaerik Northlands and Kelaan.
          An organisation dedicated to the sharing of magical resources and
          knowledge, the Guild tries to refrain from engaging in political
          matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are towers or Guild Halls in most cities across Mazrea, and each
          of these can provide, for a fee, alchemical equipment, ingredients and
          components, access to scrolls and tomes, information, and in many
          cases, teleportation to the other Guild Halls. Members of the Mages’
          Guild would also gain access to a selection of Wizard Robes, Arcane
          Focuses and other simple magical equipment, as well as enchanting
          services.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">The Temples</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          There are temples for each Pantheon throughout Mazrea, however some of
          these are limited to specific areas where the worship of these Gods is
          most common. In Gallania, the Aspects of the Moons have many places of
          worship in the Savage West, but there is little acknowledgement of
          these Gods elsewhere in Mazrea. Similarly, whilst worshipped
          throughout Mazrea, the Totems have little physical representation
          within the world; acknowledgement of the religion mostly being through
          tribal tattoos or adornments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Great Dragons have their temples throughout Gallania, but there
          are few temples to them elsewhere in the world, and the Genasi have
          placed various temples to the Primordials where they exist in any
          substantial numbers. The Elves keep to their own ways, often using
          simpler shrines and sites of natural beauty as places of worship for
          their own pantheons, though Elven Temples do exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          The large exception to this is the Temples of the Constellation.
          Almost any village in Mazrea not dedicated to a specific other
          religion will have at least a shrine in acknowledgment of the
          Constellation as a whole. Small towns will have one or more churches
          or temples that worship the entire Constellation or subsections of the
          Pantheon. It is not uncommon for certain towns and villages to have a
          place of worship dedicated to a specific God of the Constellation, and
          big cities will have a temple dedicated to every one of the
          twenty-five Gods of the Constellation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The influence of the Temples of the Constellation, especially the High
          Priests and Priestesses of the individual Gods, and indeed the High
          Clergy who preside over the entire temple is not to be underestimated.
          Their wealth and power alone is formidable in any circle, and their
          influence over the rulers and politicians of all of the nations of
          Mazrea is significant. Should the Clergy and the High Priests ever all
          agree on one single cause or action, it is likely that the world will
          swiftly follow suit and act accordingly.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">The Manufactory</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Manufactory is a large company formed by 3 artificers long ago
          that is now the biggest producer of magical items in the world, and
          the only company to mass-produce and distribute potions and magical
          goods. Mostly the Manufactory mass produces weapons capable of
          damaging ethereal or otherwise difficult to hit creatures, potions
          with various simple effects, and items of jewellery or clothing that
          can confer simple magical abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Manufactory also has an extended range called “The Adventurer’s
          Selection” that are much higher in cost and not produced on the same
          scale. These are sold as “all an adventurer needs to survive in the
          dangerous world of Mazrea” though mostly they are utility items with
          extra benefits, such as holding pouches with extra-dimensional spaces,
          easy to access and use tool-belts or tents with resistance to the
          weather and other dangers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">The Collective</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Collective are an organization spread across the world with
          various outposts and guild houses, all dedicated to collecting and
          storing information and artifacts from the entirety of Mazrea. All of
          this information is stored in multiple places, but there is a single
          museum of the Collective in Lorvallen, Beldania that is so big that
          almost nobody has explored it in full. Although it is assumed that the
          Collective also have archives they do not make available to the
          public, anything displayed or accessible to the public is stored in
          the Collective Museum in Beldania.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are countless historians, archaeologists, scholars, adventurers,
          thieves and collectors working for the Collective, seeking artifacts,
          information, history and details about anything and everything within
          the world. From detailed information on the races of the world to
          collections of stones from different mountains, from replicas of the
          many magical artifacts and weapons of history to poetry libraries, the
          Collective tries to be “a catalogue of everything there is to know in
          the world”, though obviously such a library would be impossible to
          maintain. Nevertheless, the Collective is a valuable resource both to
          those who wish to study or find information or to those who wish to
          sell magical goods, information or unusual pieces found throughout the
          world.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">
        Most Careful Order of Meteorologists
      </button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Most Careful Order of Meteorologists was established after the
          great Druid Wars of Beldania almost two centuries ago. When the druids
          in the war created cataclysmic weather effects, they had repercussions
          felt throughout the world. The Most Careful Order of Meteorologists
          are a fairly small group of powerful wizards and druids, and a fairly
          large group of researchers, scryers and observers, who work together
          to try and maintain some form of equilibrium in the weather and
          climate of the world. They are often reduced to fairly simple tasks,
          such as hiring out for ships for the wealthy or assisting farmers and
          agriculturists, but when powerful weather-changing magic occurs, or
          natural disasters, they are a faction that retains the respect,
          admiration and gratitude of many across Mazrea.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Silver Sword</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Silver Sword are a group, mostly consisting of Dragonborn, who
          attempt to maintain peace and safety across the world of Mazrea.
          Mostly operational in Gallania and Beldania, the group has been known
          to participate in various world-changing events by lending what aid
          they can, as well as offering aid and respite to many affected by
          disaster, war or politics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Silver Sword attempts to refrain from being involved in politics,
          though its stance on freedom, liberty and justice often prevents this.
          Whilst they do not directly oppose slavery, warlords, political wars
          or invasion, they are often seen helping those who become the victims
          of such things.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Mystic Eye</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Mystic Eye are a guild of seers, mystics and fortune tellers who
          are based in Mymna-Kolrik, but have guildhouses all over the world.
          For the most part, they offer divination services for financial
          compensation, usually in simple tasks such as seeking objects or
          people who are lost, scrying long distances or even communicating
          across the continents. In more recent times however, they have become
          the focus of the wealthy and powerful, who will often pay for auguries
          or predictions on upcoming decisions, events or battles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of the seers of the Mystic Eye are very truthful about the
          accuracy of their predictions, and prefer to keep to simple
          divinations and the loaning of more substantial services, though there
          are certainly some few charlatans who attempt to profit from the
          organisation’s recent rise in popularity. This has, in turn, tarnished
          the reputation of the Mystic Eye and led to the organisation cloaking
          themselves in secrecy and mystery once again in recent times.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">College of Bards</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The International College of Bards is an organisation dedicated to the
          formalisation of spoken history, legal witness and ceremonial
          assistance by the Bards of the world. Many people, especially in areas
          of less affluence, will call upon a Bard to witness an agreement or
          event, or to speak at an important milestone or moment in their lives,
          and the College attempts to maintain consistency across all of its
          members.
        </p>
        <p>
          The College of Bards is also a place where Bards can go to train and
          learn, especially the traditional bardic verses and songs of old as
          well as the important historical information a Bard is expected to
          learn. Its also a place for the study of language and the exchange of
          information regarding the modernisation and colloquialism throughout
          the various languages of Mazrea.
        </p>
        <p>
          The organisation's guild houses are also places of knowledge, often
          containing vast libraries and huge collections of instruments and
          music, and are a place for the various Bards of the world to meet with
          each other and exchange knowledge, art and pleasantries. Members are
          afforded shelter, assistance with their arts, details of vacancies in
          courts around the world and in some instances, direct sponsorship for
          their work. It is also important to note that should a Bard write a
          new piece of verse or music, they can store a copy at the guild to
          register their ownership of the piece.
