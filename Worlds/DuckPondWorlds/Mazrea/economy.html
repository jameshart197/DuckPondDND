      <h1 class="world-page-title">The Economy of Mazrea</h1>
      <p>
        The Economy of Mazrea is fairly stable throughout the world, with four
        types of currency being most common, and the value of goods remaining
        fairly balanced throughout Mazrea. Whilst magical goods have become
        cheaper in Mazrea, especially with the presence of the Manufactory,
        goods such as these remain out of reach for most of the common folk
        throughout the land. In some places, gems or other trade goods are
        accepted in lieu of coinage, though most simpler merchants will ask you
        to exchange such goods prior to paying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prices in taverns and inns are kept fairly consistent, and fairly low,
        throughout Mazrea as these are the gathering places of all but the
        lowliest of beggars or the greatest of misers. Work done on demand will
        always cost substantially more than work done prior to payment, as such
        weapons can often be found at a fairly manageable price for most who are
        considering adventure, but good armor is often difficult to come by for
        all but the wealthiest of adventurers.
      </p>
      <p>The four types of currency in Mazrea are;</p>
      <ul class="ul-bulleted" id="currency">
        <li>
          <strong>The Copper Shard</strong> - a small piece of copper with a fixing so they can be
          connected with other shards, ten of which can be put together to form
          a single large copper piece, is usually reserved for the simplest of
          goods such as bread roll or single units of widely available goods.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Copper Piece</strong> - usually the price of a simple meal in most taverns,
          these pieces are made up of ten copper shards interconnected. The
          Copper Piece is a fairly large piece of round copper with a flat face
          on either side. Ten Copper Pieces form a Silver Piece
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Silver Piece</strong> - usually the price of a simple weapon, or a night's
          stay at a tavern, is a fairly small piece wrought of silver, often
          with its face stamped in the likeness of a leader, god or some form of
          art. Silver pieces can vary in size, but are always exactly the same
          weight, and a sensible merchant weighs coinage before accepting
          payment. Ten Silver Pieces form a Gold Piece
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Gold Piece</strong> - universal in weight and accepted by everyone, is more
          than the average family would earn in a month. A gold piece can
          purchase you a well made piece of equipment, a set of artisanâ€™s tools
          or a piece of art. The Gold Piece is stamped differently from place to
          place and varies in size, but is seen as a mark of wealth for anyone
          to be carrying multiple.
