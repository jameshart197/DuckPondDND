      <p>
        The Calendar of Mazrea is made up of a 10 month year, each month
        consisting of 30 days, divided up into 3 weeks of 10 days each. This
        calendar has been in use for about 1500 years, and is based upon the 4
        moons of Mazrea; Gaecilia, Jurus, Borlean and Quan. Gaecilia’s even 30
        day cycle gives basis for the months, and the journey around the Central
        Sun takes 300 days, giving format to the calendar.

        The days are named fairly simply, from First Day to Ninth Day, and then
        Starsong is the last day of each week.

        With Gaecilia on a 30 day cycle, Jurus a 60 day cycle, Borlean a 120 day
        cycle and Quan on a 10 day cycle, nights on which the sky is “Two Moons
        Bright” are fairly common (when two moons are full or near-full in the
        sky), “Three Moons Bright” are fairly common, occurring two to three
        times a month and “Four Moons Bright” very rare. Four Moons Bright
        nights are celebrated throughout the world of Mazrea in various
        different ways. With the cycles of the moons, a night where no moon is
        in the sky is almost impossible, though nights where all the moons are
        dim are thought of as unlucky by most of Mazrea.

      <h3>Festivals of Mazrea</h3>
      <p>
        Whilst there are many festivals that occur on a smaller scale (either in
        a particular village, town or even country), there are a few festivals
        that are celebrated worldwide. These are as follows;
      </p>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">
        Night of the Evenstar (Evenstar 21)
      </button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Also known as Wintersong or The Day of Gifting in places that do not
          follow or worship the Constellation, the holiday is celebrated
          throughout the world as a day of family and friendship, and a day to
          give to those you love. Wintersong gifts can be lavish or simple, but
          it is considered extremely bad luck to give no gifts at all on the
          Night of the Evenstar. Gifts are traditionally given at sunset
          (usually fairly early in the day during this time of year) and
          throughout the day feasts and celebrations are held. After the
          gifting, it is tradition to light small candles and place them in
          holders, lanterns or containers at the door of your home, to show love
          and joy to the Evenstar.
        </p>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">
        The Day of the Dragons (Firemoot 7)
      </button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Believed to be the day on which Dragons entered the world, the Day of
          Dragons is one of the oldest festivals celebrated throughout the
          world. On this day there are traditional parades and many light
          lanterns or send lights to the sky for the Dragons to see. It is also
          common to exchange or tell fortunes on this day. It is often a day for
          music and dancing.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">
        Summer and Winter Solstice (Midsummer/Deepwinter 15)
      </button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Whilst celebrated worldwide, traditions vary from country to country
          and place to place; Much of the observance of the Solstice involves
          being present at sunrise and/or sunset and giving thanks for the day,
          and will often involve a meal shared amongst family and friends.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">
        Spirit’s Eve (Winterwane 10)
      </button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The evening on which it is believed that the barrier between the Fugue
          Plane and the Material Plane is at its lowest, ghosts and spirits who
          struggle to display physical manifestation will often appear solely on
          this day. From family ghosts to the haunted spirits of ancient
          barrows, the departed are often observed on this long evening. From
          macabre celebrations of death and haunting to gentle festivals of
          candles, observation of this festival changes from place to place.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">
        The Long Farewell (Deepwinter 30)
      </button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Often referred to as the Festival of the Departing, the Long Farewell
          is a night not only to say goodbye to those that have departed but
          also to bid farewell to the year as whole. This festival is one of the
          few observed worldwide where the tradition remains the same in all
          places; a simple bonfire, where each member of the town, village,
          community or home lays a piece of firewood on the flames. This is seen
          as putting the departed, painful memories, the year and troubles to
          rest, to burn to ashes and rise as the new day.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">
        Vela’s Bounty (Goldharvest 24)
      </button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          A day for sharing with those in need, this festival varies slightly
          differently depending on your location, but always revolves around
          sharing food or other necessities with those that have less. In much
          of Kelaan, things that you can spare are placed outside the home, for
          those in need to collect at their own will. In Gallania this is often
          a feast within the centre of the town or city for all to come, where
          those in need are gifted items. Elsewhere in the world, customs may
          vary but the theme remains the same.
        </p>

          Calendar pages with all festivals, including ones only celebrated by
          specific religions or regions, are provided below. These provide the
          moon cycles of the year 1447, during which the Elsewhither campaign
          begins. The only difference for any other years are the movements of
          Borlean, the third moon, which is on a 120 day cycle, thus differing
          from year to year.
