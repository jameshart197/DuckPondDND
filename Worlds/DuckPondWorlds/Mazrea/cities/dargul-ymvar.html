    The primary city of Dargul-Ymvar, unlike the rest of Gallania, has always
    been a city of peace even when various warlords or clans have fought over
    surrounding territories. Dargul-Ymvar is ruled by an elected council of
    Five, though much of the city administration is performed by the Temples of
    the Dragons.

  <p>
    Dargul-Ymvar, and some of the other older cities in Gallania are built for
    Dragons, with streets wide enough for a dragon to walk down, and certain
    buildings designed for the grooming, glorification and enjoyment of Dragons.
    This gives the city a sense of magnificence and means that many families
    live in huge buildings divided into smaller areas like modern-day apartment
    buildings. It also makes for one of the largest cities in the whole of
    Mazrea and the city is always being expanded. Breaking the peace within
    Dargul-Ymvar results in very swift and harsh punishment by the City Guard.

    The Grand Temples of Dargul-Ymvar are revered throughout the land of
    Gallania, and many come to visit these large and beautiful buildings, or to
    ask advice, help or healing from the clerics and priests within. Each of the
    Grand Temples is also the High Temple of its individual order, and is
    responsible for the many smaller temples both within Dargul-Ymvar and in the
    rest of Mazrea as a whole. Though the Temples of the Dragons are not
    worshipped widely throughout Mazrea, there are temples dotted across the
    lands. Most of the non-Dragonborn worshipers of the Temple of Dragons tend
    to be kobolds or those who have had their lives directly impacted by
    dragons. That being said, though they build no temples, nor attend them, the
    Temples of the Dragons follow the religion of the Dragons themselves, and
    they are the foremost followers of the religion.

    The Council of Five that rule of Dargul-Ymvar are elected once every 10
    years, though a re-election occurs if any member of the Five should die.
    Three of the Five have been on the council for over a century, and even the
    newest member of the Five has been on the council for three “turns” now. The
    Five are widely respected across Gallania, despite only having authority
    within the city itself, and are widely sought for their advice and wisdom.
    They are responsible for the administration of the city, including where and
    how it is expanded, any buildings that are built within its boundaries,
    education, taxes and welfare within the city and much else besides. Each
    member of the Five shares equal responsibility and authority for the city,
    with no individual responsibilities.
