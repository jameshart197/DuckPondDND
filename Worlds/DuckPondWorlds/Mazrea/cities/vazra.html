    Vazra is both city and duchy, unique within Gallania in that the duchy
    encompasses other major towns and cities. Once a fair-sized seaport to the
    North-East of Gallania, known for its fabulous seafood and beautiful views,
    Vazra is now one of the pre-eminent cities in the whole of Mazrea. Over the
    century and a half that Emperor Kyza’an was in power, he rebuilt Vazra to be
    the finest city in all the lands. Almost every building is covered in a
    facing of white marble and rose quartz, leading the city to sparkle in the
    sunshine. Most buildings were rebuilt to be large, but not on the scale of
    dragons such as Dargul-Ymvar, instead giving a feeling of grandiosity on a
    human scale.

    Emperor Kyza’an also built the Grand University, a series of interlinked
    buildings that is ever-expanding, designed for the study of every subject
    known to man. Many have come to study at its halls, including wizards from
    Shar, younger members of royalty from Kelaan and Beldania, and many other
    members of rich nobility. Despite this, however, the university charges no
    fees, and is open to all who wish to learn, though some of the more famous
    professors have had to limit their classes to a select few.

    Vazra has many fabulous restaurants and establishments for gambling, gaming,
    drinking and carousing. Despite the fact that many in Vazra are neither
    wealthy nor members of the nobility, even the smaller taverns and eateries
    are well regarded by visitors to the city. This has resulted in the raising
    of the most common folk to a better quality of life than they might
    experience in other lands. Combined with the fact that education is free to
    any who want it, and the welfare for those living in the city who do not
    have enough is generous, life as a commoner in Vazra is better than anywhere
    else in Mazrea. This has led to a gratitude within the populace that many
    outside of Vazra find surprising and even abhorrent, given the nature of the
    wars that have taken place in Emperor Kyza’an’s name and the prevalence of
    slavery and poverty that led to this fine city.

    Vazra is also a melting pot for the various adventurers and travellers who
    visit Gallania, as well as in recent times, the many artisans who have come
    to the call of Emperor Kyza’an for the rebuilding of Vazra, and the building
    of other cities and towns throughout the greater Duchy. This has resulted in
    a very diverse population with a huge variety of races, classes and wealth
    disparity throughout the duchy.
