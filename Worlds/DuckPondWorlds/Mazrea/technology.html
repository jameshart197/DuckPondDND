      <h1 class="world-page-title">Technology in Mazrea</h1>
      <p>
        Technology was for a long time strictly the province of slightly mad
        scientists and artificers, and often regarded as more dangerous and
        unreliable than it is worth. Even simple clockwork devices were regarded
        with suspicion and doubt. Recently, however, advances have been made in
        the creation of magically powered tools and devices, combining very
        simple technology (such as clockwork or chemically-induced reactions)
        with magic have brought technology into a more positive light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the wealthy in cities now have their buildings alarmed by simple
        magical devices with the Alarm spell embedded into them, or enjoy
        magically powered lights and water-heaters that combine simple magics
        and basic technology. Technology is becoming more present every day in
        the lives of Mazrea’s citizens, and many (mostly the wealthy) are
        enjoying an increase in their luxury accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the presence of the Manufactory, there is also a rise in
        “widely-available magical goods” which are mass-produced using artifice
        and magic combined. These can be adventuring gear, spellforged weapons
        with slots for gems that enhance the weapons or devices to simplify the
        casting and use of magic. Many wands, staves and other devices made in
        this manner have a limited number of charges that expire when used up
        and do not recharge, as such you may find wands and such devices more
        common in Mazrea, though they will not recharge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alchemy has come a long way within Mazrea and even the most simple of
        alchemists will be able to produce powerful concoctions when the
        ingredients are readily available. With the naturally magic land, much
        of Mazrea is ripe for the plants and flora that are required for such
        potions, though some ingredients, especially those harvested from
        magical creatures, are much more difficult to source.
