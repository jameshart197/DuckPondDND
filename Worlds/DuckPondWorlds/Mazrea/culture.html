      <h1 class="world-page-title">Culture in Mazrea</h1>
      <p>
        For the most part, culture is very separated by country, city or even
        village. It is worth mentioning however, that some races are regarded as
        ‘evil’ throughout the world, such as goblinfolk, orcs, and drow.
        Creatures of these races will find it difficult to enter cities, and
        must work very hard to earn the trust of their respective civilizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Religion is a key part of the culture of much of the world, and it is
        incredibly unusual to find somebody that does not follow any religion.
        Festivals, customs, traditions and even laws are often based on the
        practice and doctrine of the religions observed in those areas. Clerics
        and Priests are regarded with respect throughout Mazrea, even when
        serving a religion not observed in the area. There is very little
        rivalry between the varying Pantheons of Mazrea, and indeed in some
        places, often in the Archipelago, multiple religions are observed in the
        same place.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of the relationships between the different races of Mazrea, for
        the most part diversity is prevalent throughout the world, and most
        cities contain a wide variety of races which live peacefully within
        their walls. That being said, there are some races who are renowned for
        their casual racism and xenophobia; the Dwarves often regard any
        non-Dwarf as suspicious or simply uninteresting, Elves often regard many
        other races as simply youthful or inferior, and the Vedalken take racial
        arrogance to the extreme, regarding all races other than Vedalken as
        simple and poorly-formed. There are also some races who are treated
        unanimously badly throughout the world; Kobolds are enslaved throughout
        most of Mazrea, Bugbears and Minotaurs are often regarded as lacking
        sufficient intellect, and Yuan-ti are regarded with suspicion and fear
        (though most would say this reputation is fairly earned).
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout most of Mazrea, while there are folk who are regarded as
        ‘poor’, these people would not lack the basic necessities to live. In
        Kelaan and Maregal (in the Archipelago) however, abject poverty is
        commonplace and many die of starvation, improper hygiene, or lack of
        basic necessities. What is thought of as unconscionable in Beldania or
        Gallania, to ignore those who are suffering, is an art perfected within
        Kelaan especially. Likewise, the hoarding of wealth beyond what can be
        reasonably spent or used seems to be limited to similar places, though
        those of evil weal are an exception to this rule (such as the Leygon
        twins).
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst slavery is not illegal anywhere in the world except for Chimvaya,
        it is regarded with distaste in Beldania, some of the Archipelago and
        the Gaerik Northlands. In Kelaan however, slavery is responsible for
        much of the opulence and affluence of the country, and the country has
        progressed far beyond its rivals as a result. Escaped slaves from Kelaan
        are not often returned to the country by force, unless the owners have
        paid handsomely for the retrieval of said slaves, and in Beldania the
        act of forcibly returning slaves to Kelaan is illegal.
