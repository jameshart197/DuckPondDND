        <p>
            Sogravia is a mountainous and temperate country, cold in the winter, warm in the summer. It is verdant and
            fertile with deep forests growing in the south. The populace tend to be incredibly varied due to the number
            of refugees from surrounding areas. There is a lot of rain in Sogravia contributing to the greenery of the
            land, and the mountains, especially on the Eastern border, are high enough to be snow-covered all year
            round.
        </p>
        <p>
            The river Durvin is a combination of the river Thrak and the river Vin that flow down from the Eastern
            Mountains, and spans the entire country East to West. They join at a point oft-referred to as "centre-point"
            or "meeting-point" where there are always
            markets and trade stalls making good of the river traffic as well as the road traffic. Probably due to this,
            almost all roads in Sogravia flow through Centre-Point where it can be possible.
        </p>

            Despite the fact that a whole continent retreating into Sogravia has caused a huge influx of population, it
            has mostly increased the size of the cities, and much of the land between is fairly uninhabited except for
            the Forest-Folk and farmers. The White Mountains at the North-West of the country are home to barbarians and
            strange beasts, but are rarely explored by the civil man.
