                    <p>
                        An Alchemist is an expert at combining reagents to produce mystical effects. Alchemists use
                        their
                        creations to give life and to leech it away. Alchemy is the oldest of artificer traditions, and
                        its versatility has long been valued during times of war and peace.</p>

                    <p>
                        A Gunsmith is an Artificer who has crafted a spectacular and terrible device: a Thunder Cannon.
                        It is a weapon of unmatched destruction, and an Artificer's reason for forging such a thing is
                        varied. Some seek the power, some seek the discovery. For some it is but a tool to accomplish
                        their goal. For others, it is a culmination of their work for which all the pesky details of
                        adventuring are dedicated.

                        Given the destructive potential of a Thunder Cannon, many monsters and men may seek to seize the
                        power for themselves upon witnessing it, but even if they were to succeed they would soon find
                        that using one of these deadly tools is an art of equal mastery to forging one, something only
                        the one who forged the device will ever truly master. Each Thunder Cannon is unique work, suited
                        only to its creator.

                    <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/subclasses/313438-archanomechanist">ArcanoMechanist</a>
                    <p>
                        While every Artificer tinkers with merging arcane magic and mechanical devices, an
                        Archanomechanist specializes in using their knowledge of the arcane and the mechanical arts to
                        assemble a device that can augment their own physical capabilities. This device—known as an
                        archanomecha, or mech—enables the Archanomechanist to readily engage in physical combat, with
                        the archanomecha providing the strength for their blows and helping to shield them from harm.

                        Archanomechas vary greatly in appearance and form. Some are built like a hulking automaton, but
                        with the addition of a cockpit canopy containing a control panel of buttons and levers. Others
                        are archanomechanical suits of power armor, whose movements mimic those of the wearer and
                        enhance them with archanomechanical force.

                    <p>
                        Archivists are masters of knowledge, relying not on books or tomes or scrolls, but first hand
                        accounts from those involved. Why spend decades hunting for the truth behind an ancient stone
                        when you can ask the stone. Archivists have perfected the art of creating Artificial minds
                        inside ordinary objects.

                    <p>
                        An artificer who specializes as an Armorer modifies armor to function almost like a second skin.
                        The armor is enhanced to hone the artificer’s magic, unleash potent attacks, and generate a
                        formidable defense. The artificer bonds with this armor, becoming one with it even as they
                        experiment with it and refine its magical capabilities.</p>

                    <p>
                        An Artillerist specializes in using magic to hurl energy, projectiles, and explosions on a
                        battlefield. This destructive power is valued by armies in the wars on many different worlds.
                        And when war passes, some members of this specialization seek to build a more peaceful world by
                        using their powers to fight the resurgence of strife. The world-hopping gnome artificer Vi has
                        been especially vocal about making things right: “It’s about time we fixed things instead of
                        blowing them all to hell.”

                    <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/artificer#BattleSmith">Battle Smith</a>
                    <p>
                        Armies require protection, and someone has to put things back together if defenses fail. A
                        combination of protector and medic, a Battle Smith is an expert at defending others and
                        repairing both material and personnel. To aid in their work, Battle Smiths are usually
                        accompanied by a steel defender, a protective companion of their own creation. Many soldiers
                        tell stories of nearly dying before being saved by a Battle Smith and a steel defender.

                        In the world of Eberron, Battle Smiths played a key role in House Cannith’s work on battle
                        constructs and the original warforged, and after the Last War, these artificers led efforts to
                        aid those who were injured in the war’s horrific battles.

                    <p>
                        Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the
                        warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the
                        living. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world
                        and calls on these guardian spirits for aid.

                        Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians can better fight to protect their tribes and
                        their allies. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this
                        path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors’ deeds. These tattoos
                        tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.
