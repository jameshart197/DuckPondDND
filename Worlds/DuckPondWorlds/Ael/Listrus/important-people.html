        <h1 class="world-page-title">People of Importance in Sogravia</h1>
        <p>There are many important people within Sogravia, but most are a member of one faction or another and as such
            can be found in the relevant sections within <a href="guilds-factions.html"></a>. Those that are not
            included in one of those three factions are listed below for your convenience. It might be noted that if
            some of these are read through prior to the start of the campaign there may be minor spoilers involved,
            though for the most part, most people within Sogravia would know at least something of the people listed.
        </p>
        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">King Narus</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/npcs/sogravia/narus.jpg" alt="An image of King Narus" class="character-image">
            <p>
                King Narus is an Elf who has been the King of Sogravia for just over six centuries.

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">High Priestess Narine</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/npcs/sogravia/narine.png" alt="An image of Narine" class="character-image">
            <p>The recently appointed High Priestess of the Combined Temples, Narine took over from High Priest Baden
                who died a year ago of old age at 226. Narine is an ambitious Aasimar who has risen quickly through the
                Temple Ranks due to her fervour, powerful clerical magic and determination to see the Temples act and
                aid in the war.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Father Sebastian</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/npcs/sogravia/sebastian.jpg" alt="An image of Father Sebastian"
                class="character-image">
            <p>The second in command of the Combined Temples, Father Sebastian has held his role for over three
                centuries, and refused the post of High Priest six times. Even for a Half-Elf, Sebastian is old, and
                many say his life is prolonged by unnatural means. Nonetheless, he is regarded as a constant within the
                Combined Temples, and is known to be a gentle, loving and kind man with a reputation for justice and
                forgiveness.

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Torgar</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/npcs/sogravia/torgar.jpg" alt="An image of Torgar" class="character-image">
            <p>Once the Defender General of the Dawnguard, Torgar was replaced by Anvar about 10 years ago. There are
                many rumours and stories as to exactly what happened and why, but the general consensus is that during a
                clash with Shadowveil forces in the Killing Zone between Vanhania and Imul-Daryek, Torgar made a mistake
                that cost hundreds of lives. As such, it is believed that he was removed from his role, though given a
                handsome pension for his many great services throughout the war with the Shadowveil. These days, Torgar
                is almost always to be found at the Last Flagon in Vanhania where he both resides and frequents the bar.

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Starling</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/npcs/sogravia/starling.jpg" alt="An image of Starling" class="character-image">
            <p>
                An Elven rogue and archer who is great friends with Keilana of the Sisterhood, Starling professes no
                affiliation with any of the factions of Sogravia. Whilst she demonstrates both excellent physical skills
                and some level of magical understanding and knowledge, she is very independent and competent.
