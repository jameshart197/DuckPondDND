        <h1 class="world-page-title">The Combined Temples</h1>
        <p>
            The Combined Temples of Sogravia consist of various temples, priesthoods and cleric orders. The most
            prominent of these are the Temples of the Greater Gods; Tyr, Mystra, Lathander, Chauntea, Oghma to name just
            a few. All of these Gods are interlinked and acknowledge eachother within the world. Usually a God or
            Goddess within the pantheon of Greater Gods as they are known has a specific domain or aspect of life that
            they attend to; be it life or death itself, or music, fertility, war, justice or something more obscure.
            Humans often attempt to claim the worship of the Greater Gods as their own, as the "Human Pantheon", but in
            reality not only do many different races worship these gods, almost all races that walk upon the surface of
            Ael at least acknowledge these Gods.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nonetheless, secondary to the Greater Gods within the Combined Temples are those pantheons devoted mostly to
            Deities that claim one or few races as their own to shelter. Whether this be Dumathoin and Moradin of the
            Dwarves, or Corellon and Lyra of the Elves. Ao, father of Dragonkind or Cyrollallee goddess of Home and
            Hearth for the Halflings. Within the Combined Temples all priesthoods and clergies are acknolwedged and
            accepted, and all, in turn, answer to the High Priest or Priestess and her Councillors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Less acknowledged by many, but still part of the Combined Temples are the Lesser Powers, Demigods, primeval
            forces and Patrons that complete the United Pantheon as it has come to be known. The Combined Temples
            acknowledge each of these forms of worship, though it does regulate some of the more occult practices
            related to some of these practices. These powers can consist of strange Covens, Hags, Liches, Great Old
            Ones, Demigods, Primordials or strange tribal practices of mountain barbarians. The Combined Temples at
            least strives to understand and maintain awareness of each of these forms of worship.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whilst no form of worship is strictly prohibited by the Combined Temples, there are many practices within
            the Temples that are outlawed. Some are morbid and vile, such as ritual sacrifice or debasement, but some
            are simply outlawed either for their impracticality or dangers, such as the summoning of Demons in the
            worship of Lolth or Bhaal for example.
