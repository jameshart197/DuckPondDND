        <h1 class="The Dawnguard"></h1>
        <p>
            The Dawnguard is the combined military might of the whole of Sogravia. Whilst officially led by the King,
            the primary leader of the Dawnguard is the Commander General.
            Below the Commander General, the Dawnguard is split into 6 subsections; The Defenders, Errants, Ventures,
            Encumbents, Cohorts and City Guards.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each subsection has an individual leader (a General), and then 3 lieutenants (the Knight Captains). Below that
            are the Knights, of whom there can be many (there are over 400 Knight Defenders), or few (there are only 30
            Knight Ventures). Below those are the general soldiers, then the soldiers within their first year (known as
            Green Soldiers), and finally the Squires who aspire to become soldiers.
        </p>
        <h2>The Defenders</h2>
        <p>
            The Defenders make up the majority of members of the Dawnguard. They represent the standing army, soldiers
            defending the borders and fighting in the war with the Shadowveil.
        </p>
        <h2>The Errants</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>The Ventures</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>The Encumbents</h2>

        <h2>The Cohorts</h2>
