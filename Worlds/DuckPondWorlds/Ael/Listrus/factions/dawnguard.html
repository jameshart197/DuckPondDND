        <h1 class="world-page-title">The Dawnguard</h1>
        <p>
            The Dawnguard is the combined military might of the whole of Sogravia. Whilst officially led by the King,
            the primary leader of the Dawnguard is the Commander General.
            Below the Commander General, the Dawnguard is split into 6 subsections; The Defenders, Errants, Ventures,
            Encumbents, Cohorts and City Guards.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each subsection has an individual leader (a General), and then 3 lieutenants (the Knight Captains). Below
            that are the Knights, of whom there can be many (there are over 400 Knight Defenders), or few (there are
            only 30 Knight Ventures). Below those are the general soldiers, then the soldiers within their first year
            (known as Green Soldiers), and finally the Squires who aspire to become soldiers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Dawnguard break down the army into legions (10,000 soldiers), legions can be broken into groups of 1000
            soldiers, known as tribunes. A tribune can be further broken up into groups of 100 soldiers, known as
            companies. Companies can be broken up into groups of 10 soldiers, known as units. Each unit, company,
            tribune and legion will have a leader, who in turn reports to the leader of the larger group
            within which his group belongs, moving up the ranks until you reach the Commander General.
        </p>
        <h2>The Defenders</h2>
        <p>
            The Defenders make up the majority of members of the Dawnguard. They represent the standing army, soldiers
            defending the borders and fighting in the war with the Shadowveil. The Defenders have various units within
            them such as cavalry, archers, seige units, infantry and so on. It is primarily the Defenders that are
            supported by the Cohorts. Most Defenders are stationed at Kovach or Vanhania.
        </p>
        <h2>The Errants</h2>
        <p>
            The Errants are soldiers who mostly act on their own or in small groups. They are the soldiers that are sent
            to investigate disturbances around the country. They travel far and wide dealing with strange rumours,
            unusual occurences and issues within the peasantry. It is primarily Errants who would deal with any banditry
            or monster issues within Sogravia's borders. Errants are often strong independent soldiers used to seeing
            battle. They are often the least surprised by the occult, arcane and unusual.
        </p>
        <h2>The Ventures</h2>
        <p>
            The Ventures are the scouts. These soldiers almost always act as solos or groups of three. They are most
            renowned for their scouting missions into enemy territory, and many exploits are told of famous Ventures who
            made their way into the Shadowveil lands for scouting purposes, rescues or other daring missions. Ventures
            are the fewest in number in the Dawnguard, but have the highest death rates. Many Ventures are capable of
            flight in one way or another to aid them in scouting.
        </p>
        <h2>The Encumbents</h2>
        <p>
            The Encumbents are the royal guards, the heraldry, the army that is stationed at each city and outpost
            throughout Sogravia. Highly ceremonial, sometimes other Dawnguard disparage the Encumbents, saying they are
            not proper soldiers. However, perhaps due to the time they have spare, or perhaps due to the need to keep
            their reflexes sharp, many of the Encumbents practice in gladiator arenas and duels and are some of the best
            swordsmen in the land. There are many roles within the Encumbents that include extra resposibilities, such
            as the Heralds, musicians and Record Keepers who are a vital part of the Dawnguard for non-fighting
            purposes.
        </p>
        <h2>The Cohorts</h2>
        <p>
            Supplementary divisions within the Dawnguard, there are many cohorts, each with a specific purpose. The most
            widely known and well-regarded are the combat medics, engineers, sappers, arcane support and quartermaster
            cohorts. But there are countless more groups that contribute in various ways to the running, wellbeing and
            survival of the Dawnguard. These cohorts always have their own leaders and heirarchy, but each cohort will
            have a general who reports directly to the Commander General.
        </p>
        <h2>The City Guards</h2>
        <p>
            The City Guards are the police force that maintains the law within all the cities, towns and villages of
            Sogravia. They are part of the Dawnguard, and yet separate. Whilst most City Guards would take part in the
            defense of a city should it be attacked, for the most part they deal with petty crime, investigation and
            adjudication. There are as many lawyers and administrators in the City Guard as there are soldiers and
            policemen.
