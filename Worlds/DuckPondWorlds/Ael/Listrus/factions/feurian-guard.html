        <h1 class="world-page-title">The Feurian Guard</h1>
        <p>
            Long ago, the Celestial Church of Feuralia was renowned for its powerful Paladin Warriors. These fearsome
            combatants were the reason Feuralia was able to expand its borders so far and fare so well in war. Since the
            coming of the Shadowveil, when Feuralia was lost swiftly to Infiltration within their highest ranks, the
            church of Tyr that had produced these Paladins has been rebuilding its ranks. It is only in recent times
            that the Feurian Guard have re-emerged into the public eye, offering a solution to the Shadowveil incursion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The premise of the Feurian Guard is fairly simple. Much like the Celestial Church of Feuralia in the past,
            its goals are to bring light to the darkest of places, eradicate evil and fight against injustice. To this
            end the Aasimar leaders of the Feurian Guard believe that all those capable of bearing arms should be sworn
            into the Feurian Guard, sharing in the divine power granted by their faith and devotion to Lathander. They
            believe this army would be capable of taking the fight to the Shadowveil and ridding Listrus of them for all
            of time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Feurian Guard are led by powerful and charismatic paladin Skond, and his three Head Priests, Candus,
            Urvon and Phellin. All four of these leaders are Aasimar who have lived extended lives due to their divine
            powers and close bond with their God. Rumours have flown that the Feurian Guard have levied small villaged
            and forced them to take arms in the name of Lathander against the Shadowveil, but this has been firmly
            denied by Skond and his priests, and no evidence is forthcoming.
        </p>

            <p>
                Skond is a powerful Paladin and a charismatic leader. His rhetoric is widely regarded throughout
                Sogravia and he has brought many followers to the Feurian Guard by sheer force of personality. The
                Aasimar Paladin has been alive since the Shadowveil took his homeland, and his bond with his Head
                Priests is one of both shared history and mutual respect. He is regarded warily by high-ranking members
                of all other factions for his Divine prowess and martial capabilities.
            </p>
        </div>
        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Head Priest Candus</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/npcs/sogravia/candus.png" alt="An image of Head Priest Candus"
                class="character-image">
            <p>
                Candus is a fanatical follower of Lathander, and he has been referred to by others as the Torch for his
                love of fire, especially in wielding it against his enemies. He is a very capable fighter and a devout
                follower of Lathander who questions the beliefs of any who do not follow solely Lathander. He is
                arrogant, stubborn and difficult at the best of times.
            </p>
        </div>
        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">High Priest Urvon</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/npcs/sogravia/urvon.jpg" alt="An image of Head Priest Urvon"
                class="character-image">
            <p>
                Urvon is a practical man who puts the fight against the Shadowveil first, and all else second. Whilst
                also a devout follower of Lathander, some say he sees the religion as only a means to an end. Whether he
                would be content simply with ridding the lands of Shadowveil is unsure, but certainly his cruelty to
                those he believes infiltrated and to the Shadowveil who have been captured, makes many questions if the
                ends truly can justify the means.
            </p>
        </div>
        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Phellin</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/npcs/sogravia/phellin.jpg" alt="An image of Head Priest Phellin"
                class="character-image">
            <p>
                Known as the Gentle Warrior to many, Phellin is a powerful healer and a true devout of Lathander in all
                aspects. Whilst he is a fervent believer in ridding the world of the Shadowveil, he seeks to uphold all
                tenets of the Feurian Guard equally and believes in justice and freedom. Frequently at odds with his
                fellow Head Priests, Skond and Phellin are thought to be very close and it is often Phellin that Skond
                sends in his place when he cannot be present at a meeting.
