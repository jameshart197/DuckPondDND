        <p>
            The Sisterhood are, for the most part, considered a somewhat useful organization that deals in a mixture of
            propoganda and hope. The Sisterhood are best known for their pamphlets and posters speaking out against the
            Shadowveil and Infiltration and teaching best practices to keep your loved ones safe. Beyond this, they also
            offer sanctuary and assistance to those who have lost loved ones to the Shadowveil. A kind-hearted
            organization their charitable homes can be found everywhere from small villages to large cities, available
            to rich and poor alike.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Sisterhood are led by a group known as the Synod. These are seven "sisters" who lead the organization
            though there is a surprising amount of secrecy regarding who is or is not on the Synod. This is thought to
            be to prevent any controversies around the positions. What is known is that at least one member of the Synod
            is male, meaning that the name "Sisterhood" does not cause the exclusion of males, though most members seem
            to be female.

        <p>
            For an organization dealing largely in charity and hope, the Sisterhood seem to have fairly large resources;
            it is thought that some ladies of Noble houses make substantial donations in the hope that the Sisterhood
            can be the society that prevents them losing their noble relatives to Infiltration, for all know it is the
            nobles with wealth and power who are most at risk.
