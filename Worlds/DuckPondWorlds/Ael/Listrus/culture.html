        <h1 class="world-page-title">Culture in Sogravia</h1>
        <p>
            Due to the continuous war over the last century and more, the entirety of Sogravia has come to something of
            a cultural standstill. There is a martial air about many of the cities, a focus on defense and a standing
            army that detracts from progress in other areas. Few are the families that will pay for artwork over passage
            West or safety. Few are the potters and jewellers, for they have become soldiers in Sogravia's ever-growing
            army.
        </p>
        <h2></h2>
        <p>
            Despite this, there is still much about Sogravia that is beautiful, and much that shows not only the long
            and storied history of Sogravia itself, but in more recent times the coming together of so many cultures
            from all over Listrus. The previously private Dragonborn of the South, the Aasimar culture that was once
            quite racist and insular, are now shared freely with so many others. Craftsmenship of Dwarf and Drow sees
            the surface and human hands as it is both wielded in war and protected in home.
        </p>
        <p>
            As such the culture that has been created in Sogravia is very much one of acceptance; there is little to no
            racism or judgment of a person, even from the highest of nobility. This is because in a time of desperation
            and need, the whole nation has come together to stand united. There is, however, still a continuous divide
            between citizens; a divide based on which faction they believe is the right one to take Sogravia to safety.
