        <p>
            On the continent of Listrus, the Shadowveil have taken over the majority of the land. The only remaining
            hope for civilization is Sogravia. Kept safe from the Shadowveil by the combined forces of the Dawnguard,
            Magus Arcane and the Feurian Guard, the whole nation is at perpetual war. The strongest of survivors from
            all over Listrus have come to shelter in Sogravia, and the nation is mighty in many ways, but conflict
            exists within these boundaries; Each of the major factions believes they should rule, each believes they are
            best equipped to save the nation from certain doom.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unless some cohesion can be found between the forces within the land, unless some compromise or agreement
            can be made, it is only a matter of time before Sogravia falls to the Shadowveil. Even if a status quo can
            be found between those powers, holding the Shadowveil at bay might be impossible in the long term; already
            many in Sogravia have begun to accept the inevitable and give up the fight.
