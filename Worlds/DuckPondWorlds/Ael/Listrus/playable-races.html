        <h1 class="world-page-title">Playable Races in Xandros</h1>
        <p>Races are incredibly diverse within Ael. Due to the encoraching of the Shadowveil and the continuous war
            within the land of Listrus, there is little chance for races to keep to themselves and instead most races
            intermingle freely, resulting in a diluting of the racial stereotypes and behaviours. Sogravia is diverse
            and racism is almost unheard of within the nation. Instead, the only form of racial dominance or heirarchy
            is based on the longevity of certain races; whilst a Vedalken might not look down on a human, it is hard for
            someone who has lived a millenia to take the advice of someone who has lived barely thirty years.

                <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/591945-aaba ">Aaba on DNDBeyond</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Aabas have very distinct features that obviously single them out as being much different than just
                another common humanoid. Atop their heads are two antennas that are used for searching for food,
                communication between other aaba, and can even enhance hearing. Their legs are the most prominent
                differences between other common races, for their legs are that of massive grasshoppers that are capable
                of carrying an Aaba up to 10 times its height. Landing is not an issue because their legs easily
                retract, acting like shocks to keep them upright.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aaba skin ranges from forest green to a very dark brown. Female Aaba tend to be darker in shade than
                Males, but it can vary. Most Aaba have a pair of translucent wings that provide the gift of flight.
                However, many are unable to use them because of their curse. There are two types of Aabas, the
                Speedwings and the Chakraabas, the Speedwings are more martial in appearance and personality, the
                Chakraabas more magical.

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Aarakocra</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">

                <a href="">Aarakocra on DNDBeyond</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Aarakocra mostly originate from the high up Eyries around Sograviaâ€™s mountainous terrain. In modern
                days, despite still maintaining their Eyries in the mountains, they are the most valued of scouts and
                messengers throughout Sogravia. Given that they can fly for extended periods of time far above the many
                dangers of the land, the biggest threat to an Aarakocra is often the weather, and the most well
                outfitted messengers and couriers often have magical protection from weather and exhaustion.

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Aasimar</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/591945-aaba ">Aasimar on DNDBeyond</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                It is said that the Aasimar of Feuralia are descended from Celestial beings, or were once influenced by
                those heavenly beings. Whether that is the case or not is unknown, but what is known is that from the
                Aasimar of Feuralia rose the Feurian Guard. Aasimar tend to be deeply religious, fanatic in their
                beliefs and quick to righteous fury. Aasimar often glow faintly with the light when their anger is
                roused, and can be almost blinding to look at when they unleash their celestial wings.
