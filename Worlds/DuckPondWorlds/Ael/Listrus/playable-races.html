        <h1 class="world-page-title">Playable Races in Xandros</h1>
        <p>Races are incredibly diverse within Ael. Due to the encoraching of the Shadowveil and the continuous war
            within the land of Listrus, there is little chance for races to keep to themselves and instead most races
            intermingle freely, resulting in a diluting of the racial stereotypes and behaviours. Sogravia is diverse
            and racism is almost unheard of within the nation. Instead, the only form of racial dominance or heirarchy
            is based on the longevity of certain races; whilst a Vedalken might not look down on a human, it is hard for
            someone who has lived a millenia to take the advice of someone who has lived barely thirty years.

                <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/591945-aaba ">Aaba on DNDBeyond</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Aabas have very distinct features that obviously single them out as being much different than just
                another common humanoid. Atop their heads are two antennas that are used for searching for food,
                communication between other aaba, and can even enhance hearing. Their legs are the most prominent
                differences between other common races, for their legs are that of massive grasshoppers that are capable
                of carrying an Aaba up to 10 times its height. Landing is not an issue because their legs easily
                retract, acting like shocks to keep them upright.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aaba skin ranges from forest green to a very dark brown. Female Aaba tend to be darker in shade than
                Males, but it can vary. Most Aaba have a pair of translucent wings that provide the gift of flight.
                However, many are unable to use them because of their curse. There are two types of Aabas, the
                Speedwings and the Chakraabas, the Speedwings are more martial in appearance and personality, the
                Chakraabas more magical.

                <a href="">Aarakocra on DNDBeyond</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Aarakocra mostly originate from the high up Eyries around Sogravia’s mountainous terrain. In modern
                days, despite still maintaining their Eyries in the mountains, they are the most valued of scouts and
                messengers throughout Sogravia. Given that they can fly for extended periods of time far above the many
                dangers of the land, the biggest threat to an Aarakocra is often the weather, and the most well
                outfitted messengers and couriers often have magical protection from weather and exhaustion.

                <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/591945-aaba ">Aasimar on DNDBeyond</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                It is said that the Aasimar of Feuralia are descended from Celestial beings, or were once influenced by
                those heavenly beings. Whether that is the case or not is unknown, but what is known is that from the
                Aasimar of Feuralia rose the Feurian Guard. Aasimar tend to be deeply religious, fanatic in their
                beliefs and quick to righteous fury. Aasimar often glow faintly with the light when their anger is
                roused, and can be almost blinding to look at when they unleash their celestial wings.

                <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/591945-aaba ">Autognome on DNDBeyond</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                In Sogravia, the practice of Warforging began as a means to shut out the Shadowveil influence. Despite
                being a somewhat barbaric ritual that can be incredibly painful for the person experiencing it,
                Warforging has been made popular by the rich and aristocratic, mostly to ensure their servants and
                bodyguards cannot be infiltrated by the Shadowveil.
            </p>
            <p>
                In more recent times, the ever-creative gnomes discovered a less barbaric way of doing this, fusing
                themselves with an automated mechanical body to allow themselves to preserve their mind, whilst still
                retaining their memories and sense of self. Many gnomes have volunteered themselves to this process with
                the Magus Arcane.

            </p>
            <p>
                Bugbears are an unassuming, peaceful race for the most part with roots in the Feywild. Often preferring
                lives as travelling alchemists, huntsmen and the like, many bugbears prefer a solitary lifestyle.
                Nonetheless, due to their stature and natural martial abilities, it is not rare to find bugbears as
                soldiers and guards in the employ of the rich and wealthy.

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Centaurs</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/591945-aaba ">Centaurs on DNDBeyond</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Centaur Herds roam the hills and plains of the world and are one of the few races surviving almost
                entirely outside of the cities, always on the move. They go to the Hunt weekly and all centaurs that are
                able participate as the Herd hunts Elk, Wyverns, anything that is swift and a challenge. The Rite of the
                Hunt is sacred to them, and even Centaurs that venture elsewhere in the world will often feel the call
                to the Hunt.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Centaur are a deeply reflective folk, and they worship the stars and constellations. Most Centaurs
                are deeply prideful and will brook no insults to themselves or their people, calling any such person who
                would throw insults to the Draw, a duel sacred in the Centaur culture.
            </p>
            <p>
                Centaurs are very tribal and tend to dismiss other races as insignificant, their traditions bind them,
                but also keep them a little rural in comparison to many other races; Centaurs live on the move, and
                rarely stop in cities or towns, they trade little and they live a nomadic life. They tend to be very
                strong of arm, and have little tolerance for the old, weak or sickly. Centaurs come of age as young as
                12, and live for many centuries. In Sogravia, most Centaur have joined the army as Cavalier units and
                outside of battle keep to their herds, well outside of cities. In Eldessa the Centaurs maintain their
                Nomadic lifestyle.

                <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/591945-aaba ">Changelings on DNDBeyond</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Changelings throughout Ael are fairly rare, and have become even more so in Sogravia since the coming of
                the Shadowveil. Due to their ability to change their physical appearance to resemble another, many have
                associated them (falsely) with the Shadowveil, and many Changelings have fallen victim to propaganda.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even prior to the coming of the Shadowveil, most Changelings prefer to keep to their “colourless” form
                and many Changelings find that they struggle with their personal identity. Changelings are highly valued
                for their skills as actors, spies and courtesans, but many Changelings who change form too often find
                themselves struggling to return to their “true” forms.

        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/591945-aaba ">Dragonborn on DNDBeyond</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Like Dragons themselves, Dragonborn are diverse, fierce and incredibly proud. It is said their features
                and racial traits come from blessings upon their lineage long ago, but these days their features are
                merely hereditary. Dragonborn are as varied as humans, and are diverse in their personalities and
                histories.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many Dragonborn are alike to the Dragons that once blessed their lineage; White Dragonborns often come
                from the cold Northern stretches and mountains, Red Dragonborns often prefer sandy deserts and hot
                savannahs, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                These days however, most Dragonborn are found in cities just like other races, and though they are often
                quick-tempered, the Dragonborn are also quick to joy and laughter. Dragonborn are often mistaken for
                reptiles but are in fact warm-blooded draconic creatures with an internal temperature that is so hot as
                it may seem feverish to the human touch. Dragonborn often have deep seated traditions regarding personal
                honour.

            <p>
                <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/591945-aaba ">Dryads on DNDBeyond</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                What few Dryads there are left in Sogravia tend to stick to the forests around Kovach, though many have
                carried saplings of their “soul-trees” from far further afield. Once found throughout the great forests
                all over Listrus, the distance from their soul-trees and the forced concentration of their race, as well
                as increased exposure to others, has resulted in the Dryads becoming incredibly scarce. Those Dryads
                that do interact with others tend to be playful, mischievous and shy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bound to a tree spirit themselves, rare is it that a Dryad would venture from the forest. However, it
                does happen on occasion; there was one travelling dryad renowned in Eldessa who carried a small sapling
                of her soul tree with her as she travelled the world teaching of the strange herbs and plants she had
                discovered.

            </p>
            <p>
                Many of the Dwarves have become soldiers in the Dawnguard, due to their willingness to fight for their
                homeland, their excellent battle discipline and training and their naturally tough nature. The Dwarves
                do keep to their own home cities, with Thrakstun being the largest and most populous. Away from the
                armies, Dwarves are a clannish and independent group,with homes in mountains and hills all over the
                world. They are insular and solitary and not particularly welcoming of outsiders, though never truly
                turning anyone in need from their doorsteps.

            </p>
            <p>
                Astral Elves used to occupy the islands of Yulenta. There is a relatively small number of Astral Elves
                left within the lands of Sogravia, and those that do still survive after the coming of the Shadowveil,
                tend to be quiet, reclusive and live in isolation. Well known for their obsession with the stars and
                constellations of the night sky, and their contemplative lifestyles many Astral Elves are divination
                wizards with a light connection to the Magus Arcane for the purpose of knowledge shared.

            </p>
            <p>
                The Drow are the only race who have managed to have somewhat peaceful interaction with the Shadowveil in
                Sogravia. There is said to be great conflict between the Drow and Shadowveil in the Underdark, but
                despite this the Drow seem to also have trade and understanding with them. Outside of Sogravia, the Drow
                are a dark and mistrusted race who are regularly described as innately evil, violent and corrupt.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Drow are one of the few humanoid inhabitants of the Underdark. They have difficulty with sunlight
                and prefer only to come to the surface during the night or in places of shelter. There are, however,
                drow who trade with folk aboveground, and a few who make their names in the world above the ground have
                learnt to adapt to the sunlight. The cities of the Drow are said to be incredibly beautiful, though
                difficult to behold with human eyes.

                The Eladrin, or seasonal Elves, have been a part of the land of Jazuc long before humans arrived and
                took over. Some Eladrin change seasons often, some change with the actual seasons, and some stay one
                season for centuries or even for life. The reason for these differences is unknown, even to the Eladrin
                themselves. Eladrin are as different and varied as the humans of the world.

            <p>
                The Aristocracy of Elves, the High Elves are the city-bred elves of the common day and age. In Sogravia,
                they are often the higher-ups in the Magus Arcane. They tend towards arrogance and the belief that they
                are better than others, and most High Elves engage in at least some level of casual racism. High Elves
                tend to value their bloodlines and lineage more than most races. Oft proud and haughty, High Elves can
                often trace their bloodlines back for many millennia.

            <p>
                Somewhat primitive and savage in comparison to the other Elves, they are still the Forest-Dwelling
                simpler Elves of old. Believing that they are best served by staying close to the Earth and nature,
                these Elves avoid the cities of modern civilization as they believe that the cities have moved away from
                the Gods and the Earth itself. Keeping close to nature the Wood Elves are often ritualistic and base
                much of their lives on the seasons and moons.

            <p>
                A proud but quiet folk they describe themselves as closest to the Earth of all the Elves and are often
                reproachful of those who adopt the city lifestyle. They spend much of their time singing, dancing and
                worshipping nature but do not be fooled; most Wood Elves are deadly swordsmen and exceptional archers
                with natural magic that they can bring to bear.

                <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/591945-aaba ">Fairies on DNDBeyond</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once such a rare sight that they were believed a myth in Sogravia, since the rise of the Shadowveil, the
                Fairies have mostly joined the Magus Arcane for both protection and mutual interest. Fairies are by
                nature gentle, curious and clever and are known for their natural magical affinity. Away from Sogravia,
                Fairies tend to live in places of natural beauty, be these waterfalls, lakes, forests or otherworldly
                caverns.
            </p>
            <p>
                These small creatures tend to be solitary from the age of 9 or 10. They mature quickly although never
                truly maturing, and tend to be very nature based. Some small few have entered cities but they are few
                and far between. Usually a playful group that worship gods of laughter, joy, natural beauty and
                mischief, they are a gentle folk. They have no singular place of origin and tend not to have larger
                communities but instead smaller families dotted around. Most Fairies have inherent magic that they use
                to protect themselves despite their smaller stature, as most fairies stand between 3 and 4 feet tall.
                The nature of this magic, however, is usually the ability to hide and stay unnoticed when the larger
                folk come by.

                Flumphs communicate telepathically. Though they resemble jellyfish, flumphs are sentient beings of great
                intelligence and wisdom, possessing advanced knowledge of religion, philosophy, mathematics, and
                countless other subjects. Flumphs are sensitive to the emotional states of nearby creatures. If a
                creature's thoughts suggest goodness, a flumph seeks that creature out. When facing creatures that exude
                evil, a flumph flees.

            <p>
                The Genasi worship the Primordials as Gods, and as such have a very naturalistic essence at the core of
                their being. A water Genasi, for example, may for most of their lives operate as a normal inhabitant of
                a city, but will still retain a part of themselves that is truly elemental.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Genasi have a tendency to marry within their chosen element, though it is possible for a Fire and
                Earth Genasi, for example, to breed. Should this occur, it is up to the twists of fate which element the
                child shall be born closest to. Genasi have spread across the whole world, and are second only to humans
                in their diversity and their variety of homeplaces.

                Whether firmly as guards, bodyguards, soldiers or thugs, Gnolls usually find their way to violent
                careers and lifestyles for gnolls can be best described as aggressive, furry powerhouses. They can range
                anywhere from aggressively friendly, aggressively dogmatic, aggressively unimpressed, and just about any
                state of being you can stick ‘aggressive’ in front of.

            <p>
                Gnomes are spread throughout the world, and can vary greatly in their nature; nevertheless there is one
                trait that can link them all together, and that is curiosity. Gnomes are often found as students of the
                various arts, be they magical or scientific. They are a people who love to create, and to build, and the
                cities that gnomes have built tend to be incredibly complicated and magnificent to behold (though not
                always particularly organised!).
            </p>
            <p>
                The Forest Gnomes tend towards a more peaceful life, and are usually found dwelling on the edges of
                forests. The Rock Gnomes tend towards the crystalline groves at the foothills of mountains, and tend to
                be more of the magical arts. The Deep Gnomes tend towards the Underdark and live further from the rest
                of society than other gnomes. Less is known about these gnomes, for they venture rarely to the surface,
                but it is said they are the most incredible of builders, and have a symbiotic relationship with the
                Earth.

            <p>
                Goliaths are as cold and harsh as the lands in which they live, with voices that rumble like the
                mountains themselves and skin hardened to almost rock-like. They prefer colder climes but adapt well to
                wherever they find themselves. Goliaths are proud and have rigid codes of honour. Due to their stature
                and strength they are often found either working in construction and manual labour or as guards and
                soldiers. In the armies of Sogravia, Goliaths are the most valued of foot soldiers and are often quickly
                promoted to Captains and Legionnaires.

            <p>
                Exiled from their jungles by the coming of the Shadowveil, Hadozee in Sogravia are a somewhat tribal
                folk who keep to the edges of the forests surrounding Kovatch. There are not many of them left, and
                those that are left tend towards shyness and isolation. There are, however, a unit of Hadozee in the
                Sogravian army who are at once both terrifying and dangerous, functioning as a somewhat guerilla warband
                within the army. Away from Sogravia, Hadozee are a mostly peaceful tribal folk that keep to the upper
                reaches of the jungles and rainforests of Jazuc.

            <p>
                A blend of the long-lived Elves and the shorter, hastier humankind, Half-Elves bring traits of both.
                Half-Elves are as varied as humans and much of their heritage and culture is dependent on which Elven
                subrace they draw their ancestry from. They are shunned by neither of their parent races and fit well
                into most societies, their fine features and gentle natures often blending well with their human natural
                charisma. Each Half-Elf is different depending on which group of Elves and Humans they were born to, and
                they are as diverse as humans or Elves in that respect.

            <p>
                Despite the way most Orcs are regarded throughout the world of Aol, Half-Orcs mingle freely with others
                and face no distrust or discrimination from either side of their parentage in Miltern and Sogravia.
                Often stronger than your average humanoids, many half-orcs find themselves either in jobs of manual
                labour or physical strength, but strangely there are proportionately more Half-Orcs within the Temple
                Clergy than any other race; though most of them serve as temple guards and the like, they are still
                devout.

            <p>
                It is rare to see a good inn without at least one halfling in its’ employ; masters of hospitality,
                welcome and hearth, the comforts of home are the goal of most halflings.There are halflings who prefer a
                simpler life of agriculture or travelling collecting tales, but most halflings are found in the inns,
                taverns, food stores and bakeries of the cities of Jazuc. Halflings are affable and cheerful people,
                they cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harbouring
                few dreams of gold or glory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even the most adventurous among them usually venture into the world for reasons of community,
                friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They love discovering new things, even simple things, such as an
                exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing. Halflings make excellent merchants and negotiators and
                many have worked up the wealth to gain great importance within the cities they live in.

                fun-loving mischievous tricksters have begun to find their way into the cities. Often extremely dextrous
                and acrobatic, they are often found employed as acrobats and entertainers or in more shady pursuits
                requiring the same skill sets. Harengons are notoriously full of energy, up for a challenge and fiercely
                intelligent. In the wilderness they continually practise their quick-thinking and agility in various
                games and friendly competitions. Harengons vary between 1 and 4 feet in height.

                and enemies by most rational races, but these days their presence is tolerated, if not easily accepted.
                Hobgoblins are renowned for their martial prowess and tactical genuity, and many hobgoblin clans and
                families have been soldiers for countless generations.

                The predominant race of the modern world, many an Elf has been heard to say that Humans are conquering
                the world merely with their breeding habits. Regardless, it is true that in the world of Jazuc there are
                more humans than any other peoples. As varied as the plant life or animal life of the world, little can
                be said to generalise humans except to note that they live their lives with great passion and haste;
                this may be due to the shortness of their lives. Humans are all over the world, and are as varied as any
                race can be.
            </p>
            <p>
                Humans have been capable of the most heinous of evil crimes and the greatest of noble deeds; they are
                one of the few races that tolerate poverty, and allow members of their own race to starve and go
                homeless within their vast cities. Most Human cities are multicultural and diverse, as most humans are
                very open-minded and accepting of others, despite the way they isolate members of their own communities.
                Their cities are led by nobility and bloodline is often an important factor in the fate of a human. It
                can be impossible to judge the nature of any human by their race alone; they follow many Gods, many
                traditions and varied beliefs depending on where in the world they are born, their class, stature and
                wealth.

            <p>
                Inklings are an amphibious race. They spend most of their time frolicking around the water, enjoying the
                beauty and bounty of the water. Other races may think them frivolous, but inklings know the value of a
                good time. Under the surface (literally and figuratively) inklings understand the depth and power of the
                water, and often do their best to emulate it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inkings can alternate between a humanoid form and a squid form. In either form, they produce natural ink
                that they spit from their mouths. In both forms, a healthy sheen of moisture covers their skin.
            </p>
            <p>
                The humanoid form is slight and childlike, and has a black marking resembling a mask around their eyes,
                small round ears, and "hair" that resembles a squid's tentacles. These tentacles usually extend down the
                hips or lower back. Instead of individual teeth, they have two solid pieces of enamel similar to a
                squid's beak behind their lips.
