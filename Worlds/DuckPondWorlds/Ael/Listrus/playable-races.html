        <h1 class="world-page-title">Races in Ael</h1>
        <p>Races are incredibly diverse within Ael. Due to the encoraching of the Shadowveil and the continuous war
            within the land of Listrus, there is little chance for races to keep to themselves and instead most races
            intermingle freely, resulting in a diluting of the racial stereotypes and behaviours. Sogravia is diverse
            and racism is almost unheard of within the nation. Instead, the only form of racial dominance or heirarchy
            is based on the longevity of certain races; whilst a Vedalken might not look down on a human, it is hard for
            someone who has lived a millenia to take the advice of someone who has lived barely thirty years.

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Aaba</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/race-art/aaba.jpg" alt="An image of an Aaba" class="character-image">
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/591945-aaba " target="_blank">Aaba on DNDBeyond</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Aabas have very distinct features that obviously single them out as being much different than just
                another common humanoid. Atop their heads are two antennas that are used for searching for food,
                communication between other aaba, and can even enhance hearing. Their legs are the most prominent
                differences between other common races, for their legs are that of massive grasshoppers that are capable
                of carrying an Aaba up to 10 times its height. Landing is not an issue because their legs easily
                retract, acting like shocks to keep them upright.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aaba skin ranges from forest green to a very dark brown. Female Aaba tend to be darker in shade than
                Males, but it can vary. Most Aaba have a pair of translucent wings that provide the gift of flight.
                However, many are unable to use them because of their curse. There are two types of Aabas, the
                Speedwings and the Chakraabas, the Speedwings are more martial in appearance and personality, the
                Chakraabas more magical.

        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">

                <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/1026377-aarakocra"  target="_blank">Aarakocra on DNDBeyond</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Aarakocra mostly originate from the high up Eyries around Sogravia’s mountainous terrain. In modern
                days, despite still maintaining their Eyries in the mountains, they are the most valued of scouts and
                messengers throughout Sogravia. Given that they can fly for extended periods of time far above the many
                dangers of the land, the biggest threat to an Aarakocra is often the weather, and the most well
                outfitted messengers and couriers often have magical protection from weather and exhaustion.

            </p>
            <p>
                It is said that the Aasimar of Feuralia are descended from Celestial beings, or were once influenced by
                those heavenly beings. Whether that is the case or not is unknown, but what is known is that from the
                Aasimar of Feuralia rose the Feurian Guard. Aasimar tend to be deeply religious, fanatic in their
                beliefs and quick to righteous fury. Aasimar often glow faintly with the light when their anger is
                roused, and can be almost blinding to look at when they unleash their celestial wings.

                <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/1121695-autognome" target="_blank">Autognome on DNDBeyond</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                In Sogravia, the practice of Warforging began as a means to shut out the Shadowveil influence. Despite
                being a somewhat barbaric ritual that can be incredibly painful for the person experiencing it,
                Warforging has been made popular by the rich and aristocratic, mostly to ensure their servants and
                bodyguards cannot be infiltrated by the Shadowveil.
            </p>
            <p>
                In more recent times, the ever-creative gnomes discovered a less barbaric way of doing this, fusing
                themselves with an automated mechanical body to allow themselves to preserve their mind, whilst still
                retaining their memories and sense of self. Many gnomes have volunteered themselves to this process with
                the Magus Arcane.

                <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/1026380-bugbear" target="_blank">Bugbears on DNDBeyond</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Bugbears are an unassuming, peaceful race for the most part with roots in the Feywild. Often preferring
                lives as travelling alchemists, huntsmen and the like, many bugbears prefer a solitary lifestyle.
                Nonetheless, due to their stature and natural martial abilities, it is not rare to find bugbears as
                soldiers and guards in the employ of the rich and wealthy.

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Centaurs</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
            <img src="/assets/images/race-art/centaur.jpg" alt="An image of a Centaur" class="character-image">
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/1026381-centaur" target="_blank">Centaurs on DNDBeyond</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Centaur Herds roam the hills and plains of the world and are one of the few races surviving almost
                entirely outside of the cities, always on the move. They go to the Hunt weekly and all centaurs that are
                able participate as the Herd hunts Elk, Wyverns, anything that is swift and a challenge. The Rite of the
                Hunt is sacred to them, and even Centaurs that venture elsewhere in the world will often feel the call
                to the Hunt.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Centaur are a deeply reflective folk, and they worship the stars and constellations. Most Centaurs
                are deeply prideful and will brook no insults to themselves or their people, calling any such person who
                would throw insults to the Draw, a duel sacred in the Centaur culture.
            </p>
            <p>
                Centaurs are very tribal and tend to dismiss other races as insignificant, their traditions bind them,
                but also keep them a little rural in comparison to many other races; Centaurs live on the move, and
                rarely stop in cities or towns, they trade little and they live a nomadic life. They tend to be very
                strong of arm, and have little tolerance for the old, weak or sickly. Centaurs come of age as young as
                12, and live for many centuries. In Sogravia, most Centaur have joined the army as Cavalier units and
                outside of battle keep to their herds, well outside of cities. In Eldessa the Centaurs maintain their
                Nomadic lifestyle.

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Changeling</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">

                <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/1026382-changeling" target="_blank">Changelings on DNDBeyond</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Changelings throughout Ael are fairly rare, and have become even more so in Sogravia since the coming of
                the Shadowveil. Due to their ability to change their physical appearance to resemble another, many have
                associated them (falsely) with the Shadowveil, and many Changelings have fallen victim to propaganda.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even prior to the coming of the Shadowveil, most Changelings prefer to keep to their “colourless” form
                and many Changelings find that they struggle with their personal identity. Changelings are highly valued
                for their skills as actors, spies and courtesans, but many Changelings who change form too often find
                themselves struggling to return to their “true” forms.

        <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Dragonborn</button>
        <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">

            <p>
                <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/16-dragonborn" target="_blank">Dragonborn on DNDBeyond</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Like Dragons themselves, Dragonborn are diverse, fierce and incredibly proud. It is said their features
                and racial traits come from blessings upon their lineage long ago, but these days their features are
                merely hereditary. Dragonborn are as varied as humans, and are diverse in their personalities and
                histories.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many Dragonborn are alike to the Dragons that once blessed their lineage; White Dragonborns often come
                from the cold Northern stretches and mountains, Red Dragonborns often prefer sandy deserts and hot
                savannahs, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                These days however, most Dragonborn are found in cities just like other races, and though they are often
                quick-tempered, the Dragonborn are also quick to joy and laughter. Dragonborn are often mistaken for
                reptiles but are in fact warm-blooded draconic creatures with an internal temperature that is so hot as
                it may seem feverish to the human touch. Dragonborn often have deep seated traditions regarding personal
                honour.

                <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/2716-dryad" target="_blank">Dryads on DNDBeyond</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                What few Dryads there are left in Sogravia tend to stick to the forests around Kovach, though many have
                carried saplings of their “soul-trees” from far further afield. Once found throughout the great forests
                all over Listrus, the distance from their soul-trees and the forced concentration of their race, as well
                as increased exposure to others, has resulted in the Dryads becoming incredibly scarce. Those Dryads
                that do interact with others tend to be playful, mischievous and shy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bound to a tree spirit themselves, rare is it that a Dryad would venture from the forest. However, it
                does happen on occasion; there was one travelling dryad renowned in Eldessa who carried a small sapling
                of her soul tree with her as she travelled the world teaching of the strange herbs and plants she had
                discovered.

            </p>
            <p>
                Many of the Dwarves have become soldiers in the Dawnguard, due to their willingness to fight for their
                homeland, their excellent battle discipline and training and their naturally tough nature. The Dwarves
                do keep to their own home cities, with Thrakstun being the largest and most populous. Away from the
                armies, Dwarves are a clannish and independent group,with homes in mountains and hills all over the
                world. They are insular and solitary and not particularly welcoming of outsiders, though never truly
                turning anyone in need from their doorsteps.

            </p>
            <p>
                Astral Elves used to occupy the islands of Yulenta. There is a relatively small number of Astral Elves
                left within the lands of Sogravia, and those that do still survive after the coming of the Shadowveil,
                tend to be quiet, reclusive and live in isolation. Well known for their obsession with the stars and
                constellations of the night sky, and their contemplative lifestyles many Astral Elves are divination
                wizards with a light connection to the Magus Arcane for the purpose of knowledge shared.

            </p>
            <p>
                The Drow are the only race who have managed to have somewhat peaceful interaction with the Shadowveil in
                Sogravia. There is said to be great conflict between the Drow and Shadowveil in the Underdark, but
                despite this the Drow seem to also have trade and understanding with them. Outside of Sogravia, the Drow
                are a dark and mistrusted race who are regularly described as innately evil, violent and corrupt.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Drow are one of the few humanoid inhabitants of the Underdark. They have difficulty with sunlight
                and prefer only to come to the surface during the night or in places of shelter. There are, however,
                drow who trade with folk aboveground, and a few who make their names in the world above the ground have
                learnt to adapt to the sunlight. The cities of the Drow are said to be incredibly beautiful, though
                difficult to behold with human eyes.

            <p>
                The Eladrin, or seasonal Elves, have been a part of the land of Jazuc long before humans arrived and
                took over. Some Eladrin change seasons often, some change with the actual seasons, and some stay one
                season for centuries or even for life. The reason for these differences is unknown, even to the Eladrin
                themselves. Eladrin are as different and varied as the humans of the world.

            <p>
                The Aristocracy of Elves, the High Elves are the city-bred elves of the common day and age. In Sogravia,
                they are often the higher-ups in the Magus Arcane. They tend towards arrogance and the belief that they
                are better than others, and most High Elves engage in at least some level of casual racism. High Elves
                tend to value their bloodlines and lineage more than most races. Oft proud and haughty, High Elves can
                often trace their bloodlines back for many millennia.

                Somewhat primitive and savage in comparison to the other Elves, they are still the Forest-Dwelling
                simpler Elves of old. Believing that they are best served by staying close to the Earth and nature,
                these Elves avoid the cities of modern civilization as they believe that the cities have moved away from
                the Gods and the Earth itself. Keeping close to nature the Wood Elves are often ritualistic and base
                much of their lives on the seasons and moons.

            <p>
                A proud but quiet folk they describe themselves as closest to the Earth of all the Elves and are often
                reproachful of those who adopt the city lifestyle. They spend much of their time singing, dancing and
                worshipping nature but do not be fooled; most Wood Elves are deadly swordsmen and exceptional archers
                with natural magic that they can bring to bear.

            </p>
            <p>
                Once such a rare sight that they were believed a myth in Sogravia, since the rise of the Shadowveil, the
                Fairies have mostly joined the Magus Arcane for both protection and mutual interest. Fairies are by
                nature gentle, curious and clever and are known for their natural magical affinity. Away from Sogravia,
                Fairies tend to live in places of natural beauty, be these waterfalls, lakes, forests or otherworldly
                caverns.
            </p>
            <p>
                These small creatures tend to be solitary from the age of 9 or 10. They mature quickly although never
                truly maturing, and tend to be very nature based. Some small few have entered cities but they are few
                and far between. Usually a playful group that worship gods of laughter, joy, natural beauty and
                mischief, they are a gentle folk. They have no singular place of origin and tend not to have larger
                communities but instead smaller families dotted around. Most Fairies have inherent magic that they use
                to protect themselves despite their smaller stature, as most fairies stand between 3 and 4 feet tall.
                The nature of this magic, however, is usually the ability to hide and stay unnoticed when the larger
                folk come by.

            </p>
            <p>
                Flumphs communicate telepathically. Though they resemble jellyfish, flumphs are sentient beings of great
                intelligence and wisdom, possessing advanced knowledge of religion, philosophy, mathematics, and
                countless other subjects. Flumphs are sensitive to the emotional states of nearby creatures. If a
                creature's thoughts suggest goodness, a flumph seeks that creature out. When facing creatures that exude
                evil, a flumph flees.

            <p>
                The Genasi worship the Primordials as Gods, and as such have a very naturalistic essence at the core of
                their being. A water Genasi, for example, may for most of their lives operate as a normal inhabitant of
                a city, but will still retain a part of themselves that is truly elemental.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Genasi have a tendency to marry within their chosen element, though it is possible for a Fire and
                Earth Genasi, for example, to breed. Should this occur, it is up to the twists of fate which element the
                child shall be born closest to. Genasi have spread across the whole world, and are second only to humans
                in their diversity and their variety of homeplaces.

                Whether firmly as guards, bodyguards, soldiers or thugs, Gnolls usually find their way to violent
                careers and lifestyles for gnolls can be best described as aggressive, furry powerhouses. They can range
                anywhere from aggressively friendly, aggressively dogmatic, aggressively unimpressed, and just about any
                state of being you can stick ‘aggressive’ in front of.

            <p>
                Gnomes are spread throughout the world, and can vary greatly in their nature; nevertheless there is one
                trait that can link them all together, and that is curiosity. Gnomes are often found as students of the
                various arts, be they magical or scientific. They are a people who love to create, and to build, and the
                cities that gnomes have built tend to be incredibly complicated and magnificent to behold (though not
                always particularly organised!).
            </p>
            <p>
                The Forest Gnomes tend towards a more peaceful life, and are usually found dwelling on the edges of
                forests. The Rock Gnomes tend towards the crystalline groves at the foothills of mountains, and tend to
                be more of the magical arts. The Deep Gnomes tend towards the Underdark and live further from the rest
                of society than other gnomes. Less is known about these gnomes, for they venture rarely to the surface,
                but it is said they are the most incredible of builders, and have a symbiotic relationship with the
                Earth.

            <p>
                Goliaths are as cold and harsh as the lands in which they live, with voices that rumble like the
                mountains themselves and skin hardened to almost rock-like. They prefer colder climes but adapt well to
                wherever they find themselves. Goliaths are proud and have rigid codes of honour. Due to their stature
                and strength they are often found either working in construction and manual labour or as guards and
                soldiers. In the armies of Sogravia, Goliaths are the most valued of foot soldiers and are often quickly
                promoted to Captains and Legionnaires.

                Exiled from their jungles by the coming of the Shadowveil, Hadozee in Sogravia are a somewhat tribal
                folk who keep to the edges of the forests surrounding Kovatch. There are not many of them left, and
                those that are left tend towards shyness and isolation. There are, however, a unit of Hadozee in the
                Sogravian army who are at once both terrifying and dangerous, functioning as a somewhat guerilla warband
                within the army. Away from Sogravia, Hadozee are a mostly peaceful tribal folk that keep to the upper
                reaches of the jungles and rainforests of Jazuc.

            <p>
                A blend of the long-lived Elves and the shorter, hastier humankind, Half-Elves bring traits of both.
                Half-Elves are as varied as humans and much of their heritage and culture is dependent on which Elven
                subrace they draw their ancestry from. They are shunned by neither of their parent races and fit well
                into most societies, their fine features and gentle natures often blending well with their human natural
                charisma. Each Half-Elf is different depending on which group of Elves and Humans they were born to, and
                they are as diverse as humans or Elves in that respect.

                and face no distrust or discrimination from either side of their parentage in Miltern and Sogravia.
                Often stronger than your average humanoids, many half-orcs find themselves either in jobs of manual
                labour or physical strength, but strangely there are proportionately more Half-Orcs within the Temple
                Clergy than any other race; though most of them serve as temple guards and the like, they are still
                devout.

                It is rare to see a good inn without at least one halfling in its’ employ; masters of hospitality,
                welcome and hearth, the comforts of home are the goal of most halflings.There are halflings who prefer a
                simpler life of agriculture or travelling collecting tales, but most halflings are found in the inns,
                taverns, food stores and bakeries of the cities of Jazuc. Halflings are affable and cheerful people,
                they cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harbouring
                few dreams of gold or glory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even the most adventurous among them usually venture into the world for reasons of community,
                friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They love discovering new things, even simple things, such as an
                exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing. Halflings make excellent merchants and negotiators and
                many have worked up the wealth to gain great importance within the cities they live in.

                requiring the same skill sets. Harengons are notoriously full of energy, up for a challenge and fiercely
                intelligent. In the wilderness they continually practise their quick-thinking and agility in various
                games and friendly competitions. Harengons vary between 1 and 4 feet in height.

                and enemies by most rational races, but these days their presence is tolerated, if not easily accepted.
                Hobgoblins are renowned for their martial prowess and tactical genuity, and many hobgoblin clans and

                The predominant race of the modern world, many an Elf has been heard to say that Humans are conquering
                the world merely with their breeding habits. Regardless, it is true that in the world of Jazuc there are
                more humans than any other peoples. As varied as the plant life or animal life of the world, little can
                be said to generalise humans except to note that they live their lives with great passion and haste;
                this may be due to the shortness of their lives. Humans are all over the world, and are as varied as any
                race can be.
            </p>
            <p>
                Humans have been capable of the most heinous of evil crimes and the greatest of noble deeds; they are
                one of the few races that tolerate poverty, and allow members of their own race to starve and go
                homeless within their vast cities. Most Human cities are multicultural and diverse, as most humans are
                very open-minded and accepting of others, despite the way they isolate members of their own communities.
                Their cities are led by nobility and bloodline is often an important factor in the fate of a human. It
                can be impossible to judge the nature of any human by their race alone; they follow many Gods, many
                traditions and varied beliefs depending on where in the world they are born, their class, stature and
                wealth.

            <p>
                Inklings are an amphibious race. They spend most of their time frolicking around the water, enjoying the
                beauty and bounty of the water. Other races may think them frivolous, but inklings know the value of a
                good time. Under the surface (literally and figuratively) inklings understand the depth and power of the
                water, and often do their best to emulate it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inkings can alternate between a humanoid form and a squid form. In either form, they produce natural ink
                that they spit from their mouths. In both forms, a healthy sheen of moisture covers their skin.
            </p>
            <p>
                The humanoid form is slight and childlike, and has a black marking resembling a mask around their eyes,
                small round ears, and "hair" that resembles a squid's tentacles. These tentacles usually extend down the
                hips or lower back. Instead of individual teeth, they have two solid pieces of enamel similar to a
                squid's beak behind their lips.

            </p>
            <p>
                The Kalashtari’s origins are lost to time, but nowadays they travel freely across all of the world, for
                they are naturally explorers and wanderers at heart. Part of this is because of their nature, but for
                the most part this is because at the age of 20, when a Kalashtar comes of age, they go to seek out a
                place of natural affinity to renew their bond with the spirit that they are bound to from birth.

            </p>
            <p>
                Kalashtari are bound to prime elemental spirits when they are first born; these can be as simple as
                Earth, Fire and Air spirits, or as complex as Decay, Grazeland, Desert and Waterfall spirits. Each of
                these spirits has its own nature, and though these spirits do not talk, they can communicate feelings.
                This can lead to Kalashtari taking on certain personality traits from their spirits. A Kalshatar bound
                to an Earth Spirit for example may be a patient and gentle person, slow to anger; quite the opposite may
                be true of one bound to a Fire Spirit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kalashtar tend to stop wandering when they are due to have a child, and settle down for twenty years or
                so, before continuing on their travels when their offspring makes their spirit journey to renew their
                affinity with their spirit. Just because parents have a certain nature of spiritual bond (perhaps they
                are both bound to water spirits) it does not mean that their children will also have a similar nature.
                Most Kalashtar find themselves adventuring across the land sooner or later as the wandering urges from
                their natural spirit companions press on them to do so. A few, however, settle in a place natural to the
                spirit they are bound with, and remain there for the rest of their years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kalashtar are usually a little taller than your average humanoid, usually between 5”8 and 7 feet tall.
                They tend to be thin and willowy in nature. They tend to live approximately 120-140 years, and when they
                die, someone must take the spirit that they were bound to to a place that is natural to them to lay it
                to rest so it may return to the wilds and bind once again to a Kalashtar in the future.

                Kobolds tend to be gentle, wary and nervous creatures that rarely venture from the Underdark homes they
                live in to the surface. Most Kobolds spend their life inventing and creating, either selling their wares
                to other Underdark races or through intermediaries to the world above. Usually standing between 2 and 4
                feet tall, the dextrous Kobolds have taken to artifice like a dragon to flame. With both a natural
                affinity for magic and quick minds, they are often found to be excellent inventors, creators and
                scientists.
            </p>
            <p>
                These little beings maintain the belief that they are descendants of great dragons, and still worship
                the Great Dragons with ardour and passion. Kobolds can often trace the bloodlines of their tribes back
                many centuries and the small cultural differences between their coloration is mostly understood only by
                them.

            <p>
                Much of the Leonin history is lost within Sogravia, as they were forced from their native lands of South
                Leigon long ago by the Shadowveil. As such, many Leonin in current-day Sogravia have found their places
                within the cities and armies of Sogravia. They are fearsome combatants by virtue of their size and
                natural speed and strength. Many Leonin believe in strength of arm, skill at the hunt and have an
                intensely complicated code of honour. Many regard the traditions of the Leonin as backwards and dated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Elsewhere in the world, most Leonin are still fiercely tribal and there are still areas in which certain
                Prides reside and have done so for many years. Leonin are territorial, and it is customary to send word
                ahead of a visit. They distrust magic, and all things magical, and pay homage to various monuments
                within the islands. Water is a sacred resource to the Prides of the Leonin, and to fight near water is
                to incur the wrath of all Leonin and their Gods, or so it is believed. In tradition, water and Desert
                Oases are sacred and peaceful places where the Prides can gather to share tales and find partners.

            <p>
                The Lizardfolk are a race who seem to rush to complete as much as they can in their shorter lifespans
                than any other race. They are deeply ambitious, and apply this to whatever their trade is at the time.
                Most Lizardfolk see politics as a means to power and accomplishment, though Lizardfolk worldwide have
                been seen applying this ambition to all manners of trades and lifestyles.
            </p>
            <p>
                They are a hardy folk, and thrive in varied environments, from jungle to deserts. Jungle Lizardfolk are
                renowned for the narcotics that they both grow and trade, the Yuan-ti are especially fond of these
                narcotics and in areas of jungle you can almost always find lizardfolk and Yuan-ti living side by side.
                The Lizardfolk are often quick to violence, much as they are quick to any other action within their
                lives. Most lizardfolk seem to try to sleep as little as possible, do as much as they can within their
                days, and repeat this the following day.

            <p>
                Rare is the Loxodon who leaves their tribe, though it has been known to have happened. Loxodon tribes
                are Matriarchal, and they tend to defer to their female compatriots at all times. Loxodon stand between
                7 and 8 foot tall for the most part, are exceptionally heavy and live for 4 or 5 centuries.
            </p>
            <p>
                They are a peaceful tribal folk who tend to avoid bigger cities and towns and keep to themselves. There
                are tribes all over the world and Loxodon place great importance upon their bloodlines and ancestry.
                Within Sogravia, most Loxodon have tended either towards heavy infantry roles in the army or to the
                study of magic within the Magus Arcane; despite their prowess in both areas, most Loxodon find
                themselves in isolation - never really fitting in with those around them. Few are the Loxodon who have
                adapted to being surrounded by people and noise.

                Minotaurs tend to be guards, soldiers and mercenaries, being naturally inclined towards the warriors’
                arts. Minotaurs are very diverse in nature, some bearing large horns like a bull and some none at all.

                Mousefolk spend much of their days eating and sleeping. They tend to have extremely large families and
                value bloodlines and family over all else. The Mousefolk stand between 1 and 3 feet tall, and are
                divided into the Meadow folk and the Softpaws. Mousefolk tend to be resourceful and tenacious, and they
                believe in community over all else. The patterns of their fur dictate their hereditary history and
                family bloodlines and thus they keep incredibly good care of their fur. They are traders, craftsmen and
                hunters and are often incredibly skilled at remaining unseen.

                Most Owlin spend their lives in study and in contemplation, whether that study is of history, the arcane

                and almost all of them are nocturnal. The plumage of an Owlin develops over time with their age and
                magics, and a multi-coloured Owlin is assumably both aged and powerful in the ways of their magics.
                Owlin are often incredibly protective of their secrets and their homes and rarely venture to speak with
                the other races. Those Owlin found within Sogravia tend to study within the Magus Arcane and retain

                Satyr traditions have not changed in many centuries, and as such Satyr can be divided into four groups
                by the God they worship. Those that worship Gaecilia are the gentle forest Satyr. Those that worship
                Jurus are those that tend towards the more mischievous and criminal lives, though there are also many
                clerics of Jurus who are not criminal at all. There are those that worship Borlean and study the arcane
                arts, or become tradesfolk of the more complex type, such as apothecaries and alchemists. Most City
                Satyr worship Borlean.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, there are those that worship Quan. The Quan-worshipping Satyr are the nomadic, fun-loving, all
                singing, all dancing Satyrs for which the race is most well known. These Satyr can be found in towns and
                cities, performing on the road and in taverns and generally worshipping life, love and laughter.

                A fierce folk, excellent in battle and well known for their fearsome beastly transformations. Despite
                this, however, outside of battle the shifters are mostly a peaceful folk who worship the land and their
                totem animals. Shifters are often on the edge of wildness and can be a little chaotic however. The
                Shifters believe in being self-reliant and conjuring inner strength in times of need rather than relying
                on someone else. A common saying for a shifter is “preparing for the journey yet to come” which reflects
                how they believe the world changes constantly and its important to be prepared for whatever comes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shifters believe that the reward for this independence is freedom, and will always feel uncomfortable
                around strict authority for these reasons; Shifters often don’t meld well into settlements with complex
                law structures. Shifters often change moods in swift and dramatic fashion and find it difficult to
                control their emotions in stressful situations. Shifters often take on personality traits of their totem
                animals without meaning to; it is not uncommon to see a shifter snarl or growl.

                back to a much older time. Whilst plenty from the outside might consider the practices of the Tabaxi
                cruel, outdated and barbaric, few would say so in earshot of the stern and uncompromising race. In
                Sogravia, the Tabaxi were forced into close quarters with the many other civilised races, and as such
                have become a little more relaxed in their ways. Nevertheless within their homes, the Tabaxi remain a
                very traditional people.

                thri-kreen possess six limbs, walking on two legs and possessing four arms, each ending in four
                prehensile, claw-like fingers. The lower two arms are smaller and less-powerful than the upper two.
            </p>

                Their heads possess compound eyes, generally in somewhat-brighter colours like green or blue, antennae,
                and mandibles. Because of the alien shape of their jaws, they have difficulty speaking and pronouncing
                Common and most other humanoid languages besides their own. Thri-Kreen and Aaba are often found together

                wandering through the cities and wilderness anywhere in the world. They are a long-lived race, often
                living up to a millenia in age, and they tend to be slow to conflict, instead preferring to ponder both
                sides of any given argument. There are almost no Tortles in positions of responsibility, most instead
                preferring to remain as observers within the world. Tortles tend towards the more magical and divine
                arts rather than defending themselves with martial abilities. What few Tortles are found in Sogravia
                tend towards priesthood or study in the Magus Arcane.

                often living many centuries. They place intellectual prowess and understanding above all else, and this
                is reflected by the Gods they worship. Vedalken are often moved towards contemplative and scholarly
                lifestyles within the temple or studying the Arts; this is made all the more natural by the powerful

                infiltrated by the Shadowveil. The Warforged retain very few of their memories before their forging, and
                are often incapable of feeling some levels of empathy and emotion due to this.

                The Yuan-ti are cold blooded in more ways than one. Found on the edges of jungles and swamps where they
                can grow narcotics and pleasure drugs, the yuan-ti are a viciously competent group. The Yuan-ti are
                often pirate captains, drug traffickers and shady members of the criminal underworld. Often addicted to
                various narcotics grown within the jungles surrounding them, as many of them use anti-toxins to avoid
                being poisoned as pleasure drugs, it is rare to find a yuan-ti with a clear mind unless he is in full
                need of his wits.

            <p>
                Whilst some Yuan-ti do find their way clear of both the drugs so commonly related to them and the
                criminal upbringings they often grow up in, they are unfortunately few and far between. Yuan-ti in
                Sogravia are highly valued for their alchemical knowledge and aid with creating poisons that affect the
                Shadowveil; even so, few Yuan-ti have done much to endear themselves to the regular populace.
