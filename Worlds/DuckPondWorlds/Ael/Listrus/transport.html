            Travel throughout Sogravia is done by most on foot, by horse or wagon or along the River Durvin and its many
            tributaries. The country is approximately 500 miles across along the River Durvin and most roads between
            cities go via Centre-Point (where the rivers meet) when possible. For those with larger coin-purses there
            are teleportation circles available for use for the rich and important within each Magus Arcane outpost in
            each of the major cities.

            Private teleportation or other means of magical transport are mostly limited to those wizards who are
            capable of doing so themselves, though there are private trips available via the Guides of the Magus Arcane
            at exorbitant prices. Most travellers prefer to join caravans of merchants with wagons and horses making
            their trips in groups for safety.
