        <h1 class="world-page-title">Magic in Sogravia</h1>
        <p>
            Magic within Sogravia has been greatly concentrated due to the need for mages, wizards and clerics to defend
            the borders, produce enough food and drink for the concentrated population and ease the burden of such a
            population on such a small area. There are many who manifest minor arts who are quickly assimilated into the
            Magus Arcane for the purpose of the “Lesser Magics” as they are known. It is thought that up to 65% of the
            Magus Arcane is made up of Lesser Mages and Apprentices. These people often have only a few minor cantrips
            to their name, but assist in the creation of buildings and defences, poultices and healing equipment,
            potions and bombs, creation of food and drink, and organisation and management of the vast establishment
            that is the Magus Arcane.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are also a second large contingency of the Magus Arcane who utilise magic to enhance their other
            abilities; the majority of these are seen within the army of Sogravia, supplementing the Dawnguard with
            magic such as the ability to dig trenches quickly, build and mend defensive constructions and various other
            useful magics. In this respect, much of the Dawnguard have focused on quantity over quality and many of
            these soldiers have the potential to learn much more about their craft, just not the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite the creation of both groups listed above, there is also a vast number of mages, priests and clerics
            who do have a fairly large amount of power to call their own. Within the Magus Arcane, Feurian Guard,
            Temples and Dawnguard are found some of the most powerful Wizards, Sorcerers, Priests, Paladins and Druids
            in the land. There is a powerful group known simply as the War Mages, created by the Magus Arcane, that
            exist solely for the purpose of defence of the realm. These War Mages are highly trained and gifted wizards
            who are learned in both defensive and offensive magic to assist in the defence of Sogravia; it is largely
            due to this group alone that Sogravia still stands to this day.
