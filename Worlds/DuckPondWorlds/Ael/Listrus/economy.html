        <p>
            Since the loss of most of Listrus, there are no gold mines within the borders of Sogravia, nor silver.
            Precious gems are fewer than they once were, and some resources are scarce. To replace gold and silver as
            currency, a form of stamped wood containing silvers of gemstones has been created by the Magus Arcane for
            currency. Due to the high amount of magic in the world, some resources that would once be seen as scarce are
            now plentiful, such as food, drink and magical items.
        </p>
        <h2></h2>
        <p>
            As such, the economy is actually fairly stable, despite the times of war and lack of access to certain
            materials. The nobility were able to purchase much of the currency used now for old gold and gemstones that
            they possessed, and the value of their old gold and riches has gone up immeasurably. The nobility are thus,
            even richer than they were before. There are also thousands of peasants living in squalor trying to escape
            the deadly warfront for protection creating a wealth gap that is almost unsurmountable.
