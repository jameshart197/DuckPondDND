            Sogravia has a fairly mild climate, with relatively warm summers and fairly cold winters. The weather in
            Sogravia is fairly variable, so you can experience large changes within a day. Freezing mornings give way to
            warm afternoons, storm clouds clear to reveal clear blue skies. It can be extremely cold in the mountains of
            Sogravia and to the far North, but is fairly mild in the land trapped in between. It rains more often than
            it doesn't in Sogravia, giving the lush, green countryside its life and making travelling fairly miserable
            most of the time.

            The Shadowveil lands have changed greatly since the arrival of their forces, and weather has been corrupted
            just like every other part of the land. Huge ash storms, volcanic activity, harsh constant winds and lack of
            clear rain have left the land hard and grey. There can be wild storms, but little rain fall, and the dust
            storms can be deadly to those caught unawares. Though scouts haven't made it that deep into Shadowveil Lands
            for the most part, they all report the weather as unpredictable, unnatural and dangerous.
