        <h1 class="world-page-title">The History of Sogravia</h1>
        <p>
            The Continent of Listrus was a place of conflict, war and disputed borders long before the coming of the
            Shadowveil. For many centuries there were continuous border skirmishes, invasions and difficulties between
            neighbouring countries. Perhaps it was due to this already unsettled nature and unwillingness to cooperate
            with eachother that allowed the continent to fall so readily to the Shadowveil. They first came to the East
            Coast, disguised as travellers, merchants and such. Over time they began to infiltrate people higher up in
            command, people with more influence and more power. The Shadowveil turned border skirmishes between nations
            to all out wars. They turned internal political conflicts within the power structure of each country into
            destructive implosions of the leadership of these nations.

        <p>
            Within 25 years, they had taken Feuralia, one of the most powerful military nations on the continent, Ollusc
            and
            Gal-Goria. It was at this point, when part of the Feurian Guard of Feuralia fled west to Mistralia and
            Ranuria
            seeked aid from the Magus Arcane of Sogravia, that the rest of the continent realised there was a problem.
            Over
            the next 100 years, Leigon and Mistralia would fall, at first very slowly and then all of a sudden
            simultaneously. This left Rantura, a land of almost no military power, but great strength in trade and
            magic,
            surrounded by the Shadowveil forces. Many of those in Rantura, including those higher up in power, made a
            pact
            with the Drow to travel through the Underdark to Sogravia seeking shelter by the Magus Arcane. The Drow sold
            them out to a man and no trace of them was ever heard of again except for one man who escaped to tell the
            tale.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the falling of Ranuria and subsequently most of Sanhoven, Sogravia has stood alone against the
            Shadowveil for almost 25 years. They have done so with the aid of various powerful individuals and groups
            who have fled to their banner, but what has kept them steady through this time has been the Magus Arcane and
            the Dawnguard, continually defending the borders martially and magically as well as assisting in the
            prevention of infiltration through various careful means.
