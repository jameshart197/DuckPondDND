            Technology was, for a long time,strictly the province of tinkering gnomes in the College of Artifice inside
            the Magus Arcane. Recently, however, advances have been made in the creation of magical-powered tools, items
            and creatures that have brought technology into a much more positive light. Whether its devices that allow
            for the alarming of buildings or to survey for magical intrusion, or the simple joys of magical powered
            lights and water-heaters, technology is becoming more present every day in the lives of Sogravia's citizens.

            Technology has also advanced in other ways. In the last few decades, Warforging has become a possibility.
            Removing all memories from a person in exchange for rendering them invulnerable to the infiltration of the
            Shadowveil, many rich nobles have started to use the Warforged as expensive bodyguards and servants. Beyond
            this, some people have expressed interest in creating a Warforged army due to their nature and resistance to
            Shadowveil influence, though thus far that has only been hypothetical discussion.
        </p>

            The gnomes of the College of Artifice have found a far less brutal way of Warforging however. The creation of Autognomes is a long and
            dangerous process, and the mortality rate is fairly high. Nonetheless, many gnomes who are advancing in
            years risk both the pain and the chance of death to immortalize themselves in machine-built bodies to
            continue their fight against the Shadowveil.
