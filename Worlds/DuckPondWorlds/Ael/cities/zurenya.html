        Zurenya is the City of the Elves, situated in the North of Sogravia. Full of towering spires and dazzling
        architecture, it is commonly referred to as "fair Zurenya" and not just because of its beauty. Zurenya is a
        place with a rich cultural life and is renowned for welcoming people from all walks of life to enjoy peace and
        respite. Despite much criticism for Salmissa regarding how involved she has been with the war against the
        Shadowveil, Zurenya has taken in more refugees than anywhere other than Jastern, and shelters all equally within
        its glades.

        Zurenya is built into the natural world, as with all Elven cities, and features much of the surrounding forest
        and hills as part of its glorious scenery. Zurenya has many places to eat, drink and spend time, and is a
        cast-back to a time before the war, when peace reigned. Perhaps this is one of the reasons it is easy for any in
        Zurenya to pay less attention to the Shadowveil incursion than some think they should, for it is easy to forget
        the world in the sanctuary that is Zurenya.
