        Kovach is a martial town and a border frontier in the South-West of Sogravia. It was built only thirty years ago
        after the loss of the Halfling capital Gyria in Sandhoven. Kovach is built purely for defense and practicality
        and few live within the city that are not either fighting at the border or whose business profits from the war.
        Kovach sees more fighting than anywhere else on the Sogravian border and the walls are in a constant state of
        repair and disrepair; only the combined efforts of the Magus Arcane's wizards and the Feurian Guards constant
        strengthening of the army present has kept Kovach where it is.
