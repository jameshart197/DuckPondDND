        Karthan is home to the Magus Arcane headquarters and is a large and illustrious city in the North-West of
        Sogravia. It is a city with a lot of space, built in the shelter of the Great Mountains and is filled with
        sprawling noble manors, elegant shops and artisan stores. Karthan is the city least affected by the war with the
        Shadowveil, and it has taken in far fewer refugees than any other city. This may simply be due to the exorbitant
        cost of living here. Due to the Magus Arcane Tower within the city walls, the city is offered many of the
        benefits that are convenient for the wizards that reside there, such as magic-assisted plumbing and sewage,
        cleaning systems and fortified walls.

        There is little in the way of government within Karthan; most of the administration of the city is left to
        whichever Knight Encumbent has been placed there, the Magus Arcane and the Merchants' Guild leaders within the
        city. As such, Karthan is a mixture of stability and stagnation, neither progressing as fast as it should nor
        making any inroads towards improving the lot of those who struggle to make ends meet within the city.
        Nonetheless it remains an incredibly attractive city and one that nobles will frequent when not in Jastern.
