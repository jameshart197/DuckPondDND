        Vanhania is a martial city situated on the border South-East of Sogravia only a mile from Shadowveil Stronghold
        Imul-Daryek. Its main feature is two sets of walls, almost 80 feet in height and surrounding the entire city
        with a hundred foot gap between the two. Vast gates at the entrance in Sogravia and at the border opposite Imul
        Daryek are the only ways in, and they are powerfully protected by both manpower and arcane magics.

        Vanhania is often referred to as the 'Grey City' for its grey walls, flat and unimaginative grey architecture
        and grey stone streets. Some say that the drab nature of Vanhania brings the rain, whilst others say the
        near-constant rain in the area is the reason Vanhania is so drab. Either way, it is not a place full of much joy
        or merriment, but instead pragmatism and utility. There is no denying the formidability of this border city's
        defences however, and it is needed, for here is where the Shadowveil press the border most strongly.
