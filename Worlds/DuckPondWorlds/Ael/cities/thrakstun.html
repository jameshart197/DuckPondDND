        Thrakstun is the Dwarven Stronghold in the Eastern Mountains and is the last Dwarfhome in Listrus. The majority
        of the city is built underground, and as ever with Dwarves, it is difficult to visit those parts of the city
        unless you are a Dwarf, rich, or both. Nevertheless, those that have seen the undercity speak of vast halls,
        endless tunnels and deep, deep mines. Thrakstun is the only source of iron in Sogravia, and since the Shadowveil
        pushed the borders to the Sogravian Eastern Mountains, much as been done to ensure that Thrakstun remains in
        Dwarven hands. The Dwarves are oft-pressed defending the tunnels from incursion via the Underdark, and as such
        the martial city that has been built around the entrance to Thrakstun is mostly full of races other than Dwarves
        who work hard to protect the Dwarfhome from overground.
