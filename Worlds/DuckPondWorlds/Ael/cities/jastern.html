        Jastern is the commercial and political capital of Sogravia. A central hub that contains the Toyal Palace, the
        headquarters of both the Dawnguard and the Feurian Guard, a large tower of the Magus Arcane, and many guilds,
        establishments and temples, Jastern is a huge walled city. Divided into districts, the city contains the huge
        homes of many of the biggest of noble families, as well as many lesser mansions of other Noble houses. It also
        contains a large merchant district, the Arcade of Endless Wonders, a vast Working District and a huge
        contingency of residential buildings. There is also a Pauper’s District containing a huge percentage of the
        populace in an incredibly cramped and packed living space.

        Throughout the city are spread the City Guard, a contingent of the Dawnguard, who maintain law and order within
        the city. There are also various temples offering their services and places of peace and worship. Access to the
        Noble and Royal districts is restricted via a huge wall that is maintained by the City Guard. To pass into the
        Upper City, one most either work or live in the Upper City or have proof of their business in that part of
        Jastern, otherwise official entrance will be denied. The City Guard have the right to challenge anyone within
        the Upper City as to their presence in the area at any given time. As such “Beyond the Wall” has become a
        regular phrase in the speech of those in the Lower City.
