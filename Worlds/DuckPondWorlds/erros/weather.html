      <p>
        Trevathâ€™s climate is mostly temperate and mild, with fairly consistent
        weather. Rainfall is rarely excessive, typically somewhere between a
        mild to moderate drizzle for around a third of the year, peaking during
        the spring. Snowfall is a rare occurrence, and even during the height of
        winter it is unlikely to blanket the land. The hottest days of the year
        during summer are typically comfortable, if a little humid. The rolling
        hills in particular receive large amounts of sunlight, especially during
        summer, making the conditions perfect for the many vineyards.

        The weather of the Untamed Lands is wild and unpredictable, sometimes
        changing dramatically within the hour. This is a side-effect of the
        lingering magics that still grip the lands. Typically, conditions are
        both fairly hot and dry, and often plagued by strange weather phenomena.
        Clashing pressure fronts generate gale-force winds, kicking up dust
        storms across vast expanses. Dry thunderstorms may occur during the
        warmer days, where rain evaporates before it even reaches the ground,
        and huge streaks of lightning arc through the sky. Oftentimes the rains
        that do occur are acidic, scarring the landscape further. And during
        winter, hailstorms are not uncommon, sometimes with hailstones so large
        they can injure humanoids.
