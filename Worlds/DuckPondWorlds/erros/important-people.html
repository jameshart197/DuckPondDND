      <h1 class="world-page-title">People of Importance in Trevath</h1>
      <p>There are a few notable people in Trevath listed below.</p>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">King Darius</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <img
          src="/assets/images/npcs/erros/king-darius.jpg"
          alt="An image of King Darius"
          class="character-image"
        />
        <p>
          The grandson of King Larion, who slayed Malakai the Lich-King, King
          Darius is widely revered as a goodly Paladin, a kind King and a
          protector of the lands. He is most adored for his "Adventurer's
          Bounty", a system whereby he pays adventurers, mercenaries and other
          heroes to slay the monstrous inhabitants of the Untamed Lands. Whilst
          it has been the cause of an untimely death for many would-be heroes,
          it has also done much to increase the safety of the Southern Border of
          Trevath, and brought a stream of commerce and opportunity as well.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Archmage Kardoth</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <img
          src="/assets/images/npcs/erros/archmage-kardoth.jpg"
          alt="An image of Archmage Kardoth"
          class="character-image"
        />
        <p>
          Archmage Kardoth is an aged wizard who was alive during King Larion's
          time. He is widely respected throughout the realm, and although he
          holds no official title, King Darius is known to rely heavily on his
          advice and guidance. He is a powerful wizard with a kind heart and a
          terrifying temper when truly outraged.

      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Golwain Forest-Friend</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <img
          src="/assets/images/npcs/erros/golwain.jpg"
          alt="An image of Golwain"
          class="character-image"
        />
        <p>
          Golwain is a bear of a man with a love for tales, ale and the
          wilderness. A Ranger of some renown, he has been known in recent times
          for his extensive adventures in the Untamed Lands. Claiming no
          bounties, instead Golwain seeks to provide areas of safety and shelter
          within the Untamed Lands for would-be adventurers, as well as
          regularly offering guidance and advice on venturing into those lands.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Priest Neloth</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <img
          src="/assets/images/npcs/erros/neloth.jpg"
          alt="An image of Neloth"
          class="character-image"
        />
        <p>
          Neloth is the head of the Temple of the Constellation, despite his
          young age. He rose quickly through the ranks and is often said to be
          God-Touched and revered because of this. He is a gentle man who was
          raised as a peasant and still behaves as such in many ways, often
          mixing with the common folk despite his rather exalted rank.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Duchess Arynn</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <img
          src="/assets/images/npcs/erros/arynn.jpg"
          alt="An image of Arynn"
          class="character-image"
        />
        <p>
          Arynn is the current Duchess of Redkeep, her father having died fairly
          young and leaving her the only child. She is an adventurous sort who
          seems unwilling to settle down anytime soon. She has, despite many
          protests from her counsellors, ventured multiple times into the
          Untamed Lands to "see what adventurers in my duchy are risking every
          day of their lives". She is well liked and amiable, though perhaps a
          little naive in the eyes of her counsellors and other notable members
          of the nobility.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Ivor</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <img
          src="/assets/images/npcs/erros/ivor.jpg"
          alt="An image of Ivor"
          class="character-image"
        />
        <p>
          Ivor is a retired adventurer who is now the head of the Guild of
          Adventurers, based in Redkeep. He is a no-nonsense man who has little
          love for paperwork or administration, instead preferring to delegate
          such tasks. He does, however, insist on meeting all registered groups
          that intend to venture across the South Wall to judge them for
          himself. It is by his word alone that one can pass the South Wall into
          the Untamed Lands through Malag's Crossing.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Jurgen</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <img
          src="/assets/images/npcs/erros/jurgen.jpg"
          alt="An image of Jurgen"
          class="character-image"
        />
        <p>
          Jurgen is the town blacksmith in Redkeep, but is also a retired
          adventurer, a counsellor to the Duchess and one of the most notable
          citizens within Redkeep. He is outspoken and loud when necessary and
          unwavering in his judgment of others, though he is known to be
          sympathetic and generous at times, especially in the presence of his
          wife.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Flip</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <img
          src="/assets/images/npcs/erros/flip.jpg"
          alt="An image of Flip"
          class="character-image"
        />
        <p>
          Flip is the owner of the Trip Away Inn, the most popular and important
          inn in Redkeep, and the place where all bounty boards, quest boards
          and adventurer leagues in Trevath are posted and paid. Flip was once a
          part of the circus, and still does a little tumbling to this day. He
          is a light hearted, kind and fun-loving gnome with the spirit of
          adventure still resting inside him. He does little serving himself,
          instead preferring to coordinate his staff and mingle amongst the
          patrons bringing a smile wherever he goes.
