      <h1 class="world-page-title">Geography of Erros</h1>
      <p>
        The geography of Erros as a whole is varied, and contains a wide variety
        of biomes- from the ice sheets in the north, to the verdant forests and
        jungles to the south, and the archipelagos to the southwest. The land of
        Trevath is a land of rolling hills, open plains, lush forests, peaceful
        woodlands and gentle valleys.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trevath is a medium-sized country, taking roughly a tenday to traverse
        from the northern border to the southern border, or eastern to western,
        by horse. Snaking roads extend from the capital city of Silvercrest to
        each of the towns across the country, with smaller villages lining the
        roads at various points along the routes. Most of the grasslands and
        plains of Trevath are rather fertile, and the many open expanses make
        the land particularly arable. Many people make a living working the land
        and selling their produce. The area is particularly notable for its
        plentiful vineyards, orchards and numerous farms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The landscapes of the Untamed Lands are corrupted and broken, where dark
        magics, monstrous hordes and strange creatures have changed the land
        beyond recognition. While traversing these scarred lands, adventurers
        may encounter everything from bizarre swamplands, expanses of desiccated
        drylands, dense and ancient forests, towering sand dunes, large expanses
        of crags and stony ground, bubbling pools of lava and many other forms
        of unexpected, mysterious and broken land.
