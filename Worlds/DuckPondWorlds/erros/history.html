      <h1 class="world-page-title">The History of Erros</h1>
      <p>
        Erros is the (mostly) explored and interconnected land surrounding
        Trevath. It is the extent of the known world for most people (or beyond
        it for many), though some pirates, travellers, explorers and sailors
        claim to have seen strange lands on distant horizons.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mercenary Tales, our current campaign, is set in and around Redkeep, a
        town in Trevath. Redkeep is most notable for its proximity to the
        Untamed Lands. For almost 500 years, a powerful and dark lich called
        Malakai, ruled the lands to the South of Trevath with an iron fist.
        During his reign, he unleashed countless monsters onto the land and
        expanding his boundaries consistently, he erected dark towers of magic
        and corrupted the land around him. He also brought Orcs, Goblins,
        Gnolls, Giants and many others besides to his cause.
      </p>

      <p>
        About 100 years ago, King Larion brought together a party of the most
        powerful adventurers in all the lands, and slayed Malakai. To this day,
        however, the lands he ruled remain broken, corrupted and untamed. They
        are full of monsters and evil races and King Larionâ€™s grandson, now King
        Darius, pays well for bounty hunters and adventurers alike to hunt these
        monsters and evil beings to extinction.
      </p>

      <p>
        Due to the bounties being paid at the Trip Away Inn, and the close
        proximity to the Untamed Lands, Redkeep and its tavern has become a
        central focus point for adventurers, mercenaries and heroes from all
        over. There are bounty leaderboards, craftsmen and merchants of all
        kinds and everything else you can imagine to cater to the budding
        adventurer and their party. And as such, various people come to the
        town, and its inn, to post quests and bounties and requests.
