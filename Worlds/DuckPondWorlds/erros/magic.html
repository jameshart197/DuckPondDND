      <h1 class="world-page-title">Magic in Erros</h1>
      <p>
        Magic in Trevath is not particularly unusual; there are many
        practictioners of the Arcane, though most are small time tricksters,
        apprentice wizards or those who have learnt a small amount of the Arcane
        to assist in their daily lives (tradesfolk learning things such as
        magehand or mold earth for example).
      </p>
      <p>
        Those with more Arcane power tend to be wizards who have spent long
        years researching their arts and gathering spells to their spellbooks.
        Those to whom magic comes innately, usually referred to as sorcerers,
        are fairly unusual, and those who recieve the Arcane magics in other
        ways are few and far between. With that being said, there are many
        non-humanoids who claim the Arcane Arts as part of their nature, though
        they aren't all that common to see.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many churches, temples and other places of worship where one
        might encounter priests with the ability to cast Divine Magic spells, at
        least to some extent - Rare is the priest that can cast higher magic
        such as Greater Restoration, or even raising the dead. The Trevathion
        Shield are mostly Paladins who claim some level of Divine casting, and
        there are many Rangers, Druids and others who can tap at least some
        level of magic.
      </p>
      <p>
        As such, magic is not regarded with fear or surprise, at least at lower
        power levels (those that can cast spells of up to second level) however
        more powerful casters may garner some reputation and become known to
        authorities in the land. In the Untamed Lands, it is expected you will
        be able to cast some level of magic to venture in, and you will most
        certainly encounter others who can do so, both friend, foe and monster.
      </p>
      <h4>Summoning</h4>
      <p>
        It is considered inappropriate to summon creatures of a monstrous
        nature, or any whom are demon, devil or undead, within civilized lands.
        If you do have a servant of an unusual nature, it is appropriate to ask
        them to wait for you somewhere away from villages and towns. That being
        said, it is expected that you will use any and all powers available to
        you whilst in the Untamed Lands.
      </p>
      <h4>Necromancy</h4>
      <p>
        Necomrancy, specifically the process of reanimating the dead, or causing
        a corpse to rise, is considered distasteful in civilized lands, and
        illegal within bigger towns and cities. It is not uncommon for a temple
        practitioner to speak with the dead, but to raise them to a state of
        undeath is almost unanimously feared, due to the nature of Malakai and
        the legacy he left behind.
      </p>

          When casting this spell, it will only reveal the presence of magic in

          discern anything further.
