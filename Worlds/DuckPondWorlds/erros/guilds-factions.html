      <h1 class="world-page-title">Guilds and Factions in Erros</h1>
      <p>
        There are countless factions and guilds throughout the world of Erros,
        though most of them are involved in very specific endeavours unlikely to
        affect the average adventurer. Those that are noteworthy to adventurers
        and mercenaries within Trevath are noted below;
      </p>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Guild of Adventurers</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Guild of Adventurers are more of a charter than anything else.
          With little influence, almost no direct purpose and very little
          cooperation within the guild, the purpose of the Guild is mostly to
          acknowledge who may pass into the Untamed Lands through Malag's
          Crossing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond this, there are some shared resources and connections within
          the guild, such as wholesale purchase and subsequent resale of various
          equipment and goods that can be useful to adventurers, that can
          benefit most parties.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Trevathion Shield</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Trevation Shield are soldiers of goodly weal, mostly paladins, who
          answer directly to King Darius. Whilst the wider Trevathion army is
          made up of many soldiers with different skills and ability, the Shield
          are almost entirely Paladins who are extremely capable in single
          combat. The members of the Shield are often sent to their tasks
          individually or in small groups and are rarely called upon in greater
          numbers, and their tasks are varied and vast.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not unusual to see a member of the Trevathion Shield escorting a
          noble across the land, bringing a criminal in for questioning or
          battling unusual monsters on the border. They are also known to be
          kindly folk who will often help with smaller matters in a village, and
          have some level of governmental command, at least enough to make small
          judgments in matters of law in the minor villages and hamlets of
          Trevath.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">The Council of Eight</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Council of Eight are eight men of power who advise King Darius
          directly, and are some of the most important members of the nobility
          within Trevath. Despite this, there are many who believe that whilst
          their conversations may aid the King in his thoughts, their actual
          influence is fairly minor, and the King is wont to make his own
          choices more often than not. The Council do have lands granted to them
          by Royal Decree but most of these are administrated by lesser nobility
          within smaller sections of their lands.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">
        Temple of the Constellation
      </button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Temple of the Constellation have respect from all within Trevath
          and are unquestioned in matters divine by most that follow the
          religion, which most people within Trevath do. They are the temple
          called upon when there are questions pertaining to the divine within
          the council or King's court, and as such command a lot of power and
          respect.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Wizard's Consortium</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Wizard's Consortium are far more concerned with the pursuit of
          knowledge and understanding of the Weave than they are with politics
          or any other more material matters. Many who join the Wizard's
          Consortium do so to aid their own learning and understanding and to
          share in the resources collected. There is a small section of the
          guild who believe that all magical artifacts found in the Untamed
          Lands should be studied by the Consortium before their use is
          permitted (or they are sold), but most acknowledge that this is fairly
          unrealistic. Whilst not strictly a political faction, the Wizard's
          Consortium is called upon by the King and his Court to answer
          questions pertaining to matters of the Arcane and do wield a
          substantial amount of influence when magic is in question.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">
        The Hand of the Righteous
      </button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Hand of the Righteous are a small guild of Paladins devoted to the
          extermination of Evil within the Untamed Lands. They are notorious for
          their unwavering beliefs, notable courage and honor and lack of
          cooperation with adventuring parties. Whilst the guild do post
          requests for aid and assistance from time to time, they do not collect
          the bounties from the Untamed Lands and turn most of their profit over
          to the King or to the bettering of their knights.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Other Factions</h3>
      <p>
        These other factions can be found throughout Trevath, mostly based
        either in Redkeep or Silvercrest, though many many have embassies or
        outlets in other places around the world.
