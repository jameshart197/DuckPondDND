        <p>
          Oft proud and haughty, High Elves can often trace their bloodlines
          back for many millennia. Many have found their way into the nobility
          or other seats of power of various cities with their ancient wealth
          and endless patience

          Wood Elves tend to be a proud but quiet folk they describe themselves
          as closest to the Earth of all the Elves and are often reproachful of
          those who adopt the city lifestyle. They spend much of their time
          singing, dancing and worshipping nature but do not be fooled; most
          Wood Elves are deadly swordsmen and exceptional archers with natural
          magic that they can bring to bear.

        <p>
          A clannish and independent group, Dwarves have their homes in
          mountains and hills all over the world, though they keep themselves
          mostly to themselves. They are insular and solitary and not
          particularly welcoming of outsiders, though never truly turning anyone
          in need from their doorsteps. They are notoriously racist however, and
          will always value the lives of Dwarves above any others. They tend to
          stick to their large underground cities, though some dwarves have
          chosen to venture forth from these citadels to visit the wider world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mountain Dwarves and Hill Dwarves are the variants of Dwarves notable
          within Trevath. Mountain Dwarves tend to be a gruff and cynical
          people, and take time to trust and even longer to forgive. They are
          often adventurous in their younger years and are traditionally fairly
          martial in nature. Hill Dwarves tend to be a little more materialistic
          and ritualistic, valuing themselves and others by what they possess
          and their wealth and reputation. They tend to be deeply conservative,
          rooting their values and beliefs in traditions that have survived for
          millennia even as the world changes around them. From infancy, Hill
          Dwarves are taught that their life is determined by tradition, from
          what their profession should be to who they should marry.

        </p>
        <p>
          Gnomes are spread throughout the world, and can vary greatly in their
          nature; nevertheless there is one trait that can link them all
          together, and that is curiosity. Gnomes are often found as students of
          the various arts, be they magical or scientific. They are a people who
          love to create, and to build, and their constructions are often
          incredibly complicated and magnificent to behold.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Forest Gnomes tend towards a more peaceful life, and are usually
          found dwelling on the edges of forests. The Rock Gnomes tend towards
          the crystalline groves at the foothills of mountains, and tend to be
          more of the magical arts.

        </p>
        <p>
          The predominant race in Trevath many an Elf has been heard to say that
          Humans are conquering the world merely with their breeding habits.
          Regardless, it is certainly true that in Trevath there are more humans
          than any other peoples. As varied as the plant life or animal life of
          the world, little can be said to generalise humans except to note that
          they live their lives with great passion and haste; this may be due to
          the shortness of their lives. Humans are all over the world, and are
          as varied as any race can be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Humans have been capable of the most heinous of evil crimes and the
          greatest of noble deeds; they are one of the few races that tolerate
          poverty, and allow members of their own race to starve and go homeless
          within their vast cities. Most Human cities are multicultural and
          diverse, as most humans are very open-minded and accepting of others,
          despite the way they isolate members of their own communities. Their
          cities are led by nobility and bloodline is often an important factor
          in the fate of a human. It can be impossible to judge the nature of
          any human by their race alone; they follow many Gods, many traditions
          and varied beliefs depending on where in the world they are born,
          their class, stature and wealth.

        <img

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          A blend of the long-lived Elves and the shorter, hastier humankind,
          Half-Elves bring traits of both. Half-Elves are as varied as humans
          and much of their heritage and culture is dependent on which Elven
          subrace they draw their ancestry from. They are shunned by neither of
          their parent races and fit well into most societies, their fine
          features and gentle natures often blending well with their human
          natural charisma. Each Half-Elf is different depending on which group
          of Elves and Humans they were born to, and they are as diverse as
          humans or Elves in that respect.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Halfling</button>

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          It is rare to see a good inn without at least one halfling in itsâ€™
          employ; masters of hospitality, welcome and hearth, the comforts of
          home are the goal of most halflings.There are halflings who prefer a
          simpler life of agriculture or travelling collecting tales, but most
          halflings are found in the inns, taverns, food stores and bakeries of
          Trevath. Halflings are affable and cheerful people, they cherish the
          bonds of family and friendship as well as the comforts of hearth and
          home, harbouring few dreams of gold or glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even the most adventurous among them usually venture into the world
          for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They
          love discovering new things, even simple things, such as an exotic
          food or an unfamiliar style of clothing. Halflings make excellent
          merchants and negotiators and many have worked up the wealth to gain
          great importance within the cities they live in.
