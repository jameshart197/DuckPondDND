      <p>
        In Trevath, there has been peace for over 100 years, with very few
        conflicts on any borders. Silvercrest is home to the great Paladin King
        Darius and the Trevathion Shield whose knights keep the peace within the
        land. The Lords and Ladies, Dukes and Duchesses and other Nobility are
        his loyal subjects, and rule smaller areas of land on his behalf, and
        the smallfolk pay vassalage to them in return. Taxes are fairly low, the
        land is rich in resources and with almost no border trouble Trevath is
        as prosperous as it has ever been.

        The Untamed Lands to the South are much as the name implies - although
        the Lich-King Malakai has been dead over 100 years, his legacy remains
        in the form of broken land, terrifying monsters and latent dark magics.
        There are many ruins and abandoned keeps that the adventurous have
        attempted to excavate, often resulting in their demise. There are hoards
        of treasures untold hidden within these lands, but they are truly
        dangerous even to the hardiest of parties. The further South one
        travels, the more dangerous it gets, and nobody knows if there is
        civilization somewhere further South than these lands.
      </p>

        In and around Trevath are the lands of Sunbaar and Arugat to the East,
        home to seafaring folk and island dwellers, as well as the dragonfolk of
        Sunbaar. Whilst there is little conflict on the borders, often due to
        the barrier of the Greenwood between the lands, there is little
        friendship either. Locailun to the north is home to the hardier Northern
        folk, who regularly come to trade their unusual goods in Ramsey and even
        Silvercrest. Whilst the mountains and ice plains do not have much in the
        way of cities and sophistication, its said that the wonders are many and
        varied.

        Wardon, although an independent nation, could easily be mistaken as part
        of Trevath. Those that live there are peaceful and friendly folk for the
        most part, and the separation is mainly due to their unusual religious
        beliefs, following the Totemic beliefs of old. Many of the folk here are
        magical in nature, and a little unusual to Trevathions.
      </p>

        To the West, Gorvaz is the Ancestral Homeland of the Dwarves, and there
        are many grand citadels within the land. Overground the terrain can be
        almost unpassable at times, being hugely mountainous and exceptionally
        dry, though folk do live in thewse lands. To the South of this is
        Vasana, a fair land home to many Elves, including the Sea Elves. Whilst
        they are very welcoming of travelers, very few who are not Elves choose
        to stay in Vasana's lands.
