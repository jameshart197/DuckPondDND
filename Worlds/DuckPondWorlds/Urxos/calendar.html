      <p>
        The calendar of Urxos is based on 10 day weeks. Each month has three
        weeks. The year is split over 12 months, each of these 30 days. On the
        1st and 15th of each month there is a festival day. Some festivals are
        much more closely observed than others, but these festivals are noted
        throughout Urxos. One festival might see a lot more celebration in some
        countries than others, but most festivals are at least given some
        attention. In Anarkesia it is very typical of high labour jobs to give 1
        day's holiday for the Mid-Festival and 2 days holiday for the
        End-Festival, resulting in 3 days off per month, the 1st, 15th and 30th.

                costumes. Recently, in Anarkesia, it has also become traditional
