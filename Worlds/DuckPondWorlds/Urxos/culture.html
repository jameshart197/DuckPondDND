      <h1 class="world-page-title">Culture in Urxos</h1>
      <p>
        For the most part, cultures are very separated by country. It is very
        worth knowing however, that there are very few races that are segregated
        or shunned within the world. Whilst some people may find that which a
        doppelganger does a little distasteful, or the origins of the
        Abominations, Werewolves and Vampires a little frightening, they are
        regarded as normal citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further to this, races that in some games may be viewed as “evil” or
        “good” are not viewed any differently to any other races. Whilst racism
        can be prevalent in the world of Urxos, it is mostly based on individual
        beliefs or preferences, not on any traditionally held views. There are
        no races regarded as innately evil within the cities and even some
        monsters are regarded well for their abilities if they are willing to
        hold a truce.

        It should also be noted that whilst worship of the Seven is still a part
        of many peoples' lives, it is not as central as it perhaps used to be.
        There are also still some who hold to the Old Gods, but since the fall
        of the Obirith, that is extremely rare. There is also a high prevalence
        of Demons, Devils, Celestials and many others who in other campaigns
        might be seen as unusual or exist on other planes.

        In Anarkesia, the festivals are observed quite closely, mostly due to
        the large amount of commercialism and marketing surrounding them.
        Anarkesia is incredibly diverse, and it is not unusual to see marriages
        and relationships between all sorts of different races. The most common
        form of separation and discrimination in Anarkesia is class based, and
        there are now entire areas of the city that are off limits to those not
        owning a pass, which excludes most of the lower classes.
