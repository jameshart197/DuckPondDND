      <p>
        In Urxos, the presence of Demons, Devils and Celestials as well as the
        high prevalence of pollution has resulted in a corruption of the weather
        systems. It is not uncommon in Northern states to find Acid Rain,
        Electric Storms and hailstones large enough to hurt the average
        humanoid. In the desert lands, sandstorms are commonplace and can often
        be blinding to any that pass through them. In the Southern States
        blizzards are commonplace throughout the year, and in the winters,
        darkness can take hold for weeks on end. The sunlight, when it does
        return, can be blinding upon the permanent glaciers and many races take
        shelter underground throughout the year. Weather in Urxos, above all, is
        unpredictable. At times it may be raining acid and then immediately dry
        for a week. Growth of crops is a complete lottery, and many rely on the
        steady food coming out of Kortirion, which is guided by its own weather
        being above the clouds and within a bubble of magical temperance.

        Although both Korkros and Ngawala are primarily hot, they are often
        still under the smog of pollution and are unnaturally vivid in colour.
        Ngawala rarely sees rain during the summer, instead dealing with
        dust-storms and strange weather phenomena during the night such as rock
        storms and “dry lightning” - electrical storms during which thunder and
        lightning happen but rainfall does not occur. Korkros sees rain at the
        borders, but central Korkros has not seen rain in over a century. Nor in
        Viraldu either, where rain has never been seen, and due to the insular
        nature of its populace, rain is in fact unheard of.

        In the Kinischiro Republic, monsoon season lasts half the year, and the
        continuous rains give great fertility to the soil at the cost of regular
        flooding. Often, the excess moisture from Kinischiro drifts southward,
        towards Thuabu, though the climate is too cold and frigid for the air to
        retain this, and it regularly falls as snow and ice in the Qillian
        mountain range. Within the oceans there are storms that can rage for
        days on end, causing great disruption and waves that can consume boats
        whole. Although within the Caorsian Bay these are mostly under control,
        the external seas are almost entirely untravelled in this age.

        In Anarkesia, weather is similiar to the other Northern States outside
        of the main cities. However, there are atmospheric bubbles around each
        of the three main cities keeping the weather fairly consistent and
        manageable. This does not, in effect, change the weather from outside
        the bubble, but just reduces its impact greatly. Heavy acid rain might
        result in a fairly heavy fall of only water inside the city, strong
        winds outside might result in a medium breeze inside the city and so on.
