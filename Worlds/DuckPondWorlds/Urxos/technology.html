      <p>
        The many widespread applications of technology within Urxos are powered
        by a process called Electrolosis. Electrolosis is the process of
        converting the natural magic of the diamonds excavated from the Deep
        mines of Ngwala into a usable resource for advanced technologies. The
        majority of technology uses very little of this magic, and only requires
        tiny diamonds. The Anarkesians have mastered the art of grinding these
        diamonds into dust, allowing them to power a wide variety of simple
        objects, such as lights, using only trace amounts of this resource. This
        process was originally invented by a rock gnome named Ceroxis, and
        refined over more than three centuries of further developments and
        innovations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In layman’s terms, the process of electrolosis involves the channelling
        of magic within the diamond into the whole of an item or object. This
        process requires somebody who understands the intrinsic workings of
        electrolosis and a mage of reasonable power with the capacity for
        intense focus. In Urxos, as a whole, electrolosis technology is fairly
        commonplace, used for simple items- such as flashlights, street lamps,
        heaters, automatic doors, and surveillance cameras. However, in
        Anarkesia, this technology is taken to a whole new level.

      <p>
        In Anarkesia, tech isn’t just used to solve large-scale issues, but to
        enhance comfort, for entertainment, to replace magic, and to facilitate
        living in ways that were previously impossible. Examples of this range
        from everyday citizens having the ability to fly, to individuals living
        in a virtual fantasy reality for almost all of their waking day. To live
        in Anarkesia is to be both surrounded by and powered by Electrolosis,
        from the implants within your head, the house you live in, to the
        transport you take to work.
