      <p>
        Urxos is a highly technologically-advanced world where there is
        generally a technology-based solution to every problem. The world is
        very much divided; different countries or nation-states are at different
        stages in development, though the least developed of these is still far
        beyond Earth of the present day. Due to the plethora of technological
        solutions, magic and other traditional methods of problem solving,
        warfare, and comfort have fallen by the wayside in favour of new tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        Urxos is an extremely diverse world; in a single city there are dozens
        of different races, a tremendous wealth disparity, completely different
        living conditions, varying methods of transport and a wide spread of
        magical and technological ability. In Anarkesia, there is very little
        discrimination in terms of race, capability, or employment. However,
        there is a vast class divide, not only in terms of wealth but also
        between varying amounts of opportunity based on location, family history
        and the level of technological enhancement an individual has.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the significant class disparity, even the worst-off individuals
        in Anarkesia live in an environment that is superbly clean with
        atmospheric protection systems, and have complete safety from the
        threats of the wilderness. Almost no humanoids live in the wilderness
        outside the main cities of Anarkesia, or even in the whole of Urxos.
        This is because the dangers of the Wilderness include untamed
        elementals, roaming giants, wild magic and highly advanced and mutated
        wild beasts and monsters. This is in addition to the deadly weather,
        inhospitable environments and complete lack of sustainable nourishment.
