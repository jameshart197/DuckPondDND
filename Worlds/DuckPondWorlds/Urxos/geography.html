      <h1 class="world-page-title">Geography of urxos</h1>
      <p>
        Anarkesia was once a land of volcanic rock and barren wasteland. The
        Anarkesians, however, are the foremost architects of Urxos, and have
        transformed this otherwise inhospitable landscape into a true wonder of
        technology. With the three cities growing quickly enough that the
        borders almost touch, this country is a land of roads, skyscrapers, and
        commerce. The populace was originally human, but these days you can find
        as many warforged as you can humans, and almost as many tourists and
        immigrants as natives. The language of Anarkesia is primarily common,
        although there are many speakers of other languages within the cities,
        as a result of the influx of people from other territories.

      <h2>Tethoris</h2>
      <p>
        Tethoris is a vast metropolis in its own right, with a skyline that will
        make you dizzy as you walk through the streets. It is very common while
        walking through the bustling highstreets of Tethoris to see many
        tourists walking around, staring at the sky. This technological giant of
        a city has turned Electrolosis into the most common of resources,
        meaning even those that live in poverty on the outskirts still have
        access to automated lights and heating. Tethoris has a criminal
        underworld as huge as the city above it, where illicit goods from all
        over the world can be purchased as well as the unusual Electrolosis
        innovations used to access new heights of hedonism and indulgence.
      </p>
      <h2>Lextor</h2>
      <p>
        Lextor is home to the Sezencar, thus meaning that as much of the city is
        in the heights, accessible only by these vehicles, as is on the ground.
        At ground level the city is home to wide avenues and meandering
        boulevards; this does not, however, take away from the fact that there
        may well be a motorway above your head. The permanence of the pollution
        here and the presence of continuous city lights leads to a strange
        skyline of gold and blue.
      </p>
      <h2>Taxlington</h2>
      <p>
        Taxlington is the industrial capital of Anarkesia, with Electrolosis
        factories and industrial buildings widespread throughout the city. As
        such, the residents are less wealthy than those of neighbouring cities,
        and many a business owner here will keep a home and his family in Lextor
        or Tethoris. Under a permanent smog of pollution, the night sky in
        Taxlington is as red as it is black.
