      <h1 class="world-page-title">The Economy of Urxos</h1>
      <p>
        The economy of Urxos is varied from nation to nation, but every country
        now uses the same currency, which are called Credits. People have been
        splitting credits into Gold, Silver and Copper Credits to make it easier
        to comprehend larger sums, but it still works out to the same amount.
        There are three ways of carrying credit; Firstly on a Goldband, a
        wristband that pierces the skin slightly that directly links to your
        Credit Account. Secondly, on a ChipCard, which is linked directly to
        your account. These require face recognition to work. Thirdly, and most
        popular in Anarkesia, are wrist chips known as ID Chips, which are
        implanted into the wrist, and contain not only your personal
        identification and information, but a link to your account and a means
        of paying for any transaction.

      <p>
        In Anarkesia, the wealth disparity is vast. Some of the richest men and
        women in the world live in Anarkesia, and their wealth is comparable to
        that of some other countries. Huge companies such as Vega Transport,
        Jorgen Pharmaceuticals, Uplink, SSec, GoLive and MediCorp have budgets
        to rival the Anarkesian Government and are owned by a single man or
        woman. In comparison, many in Anarkesia, some 5% or more, are living on
        the streets or in dark areas of Perdition, Anarkesia's dark Underworld.
        Many others besides, at least 40%, are working 7 day weeks in factories
        or other hard labour jobs without enough money to cover their costs.
        Even beyond that, most of the population, another 40% or so are just
        about comfortable if they manage their money wisely. There is also an
        aristocracy, including older families of wealth, wealthy investors and
        lesser business owners that make up the rest of the population.
