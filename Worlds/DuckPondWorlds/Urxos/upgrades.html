      <p>
        In Anarkesia, personal technological enhancements can be broken down
        into three categories; implants, upgrades and augments. Implants are
        mental enhancements that allow the user to do things they otherwise
        would be unable to do, such as casting spells or telepathic
        communication. Upgrades are enhancements to the already existing
        abilities of a user, such as increased strength or capacity to cast
        spells within a day. Augments are physical upgrades or replacements to
        parts of the body, such as cybernetic limbs or artificial eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Almost every humanoid citizen in Anarkesia has three technological
        implants. These are as follows;
        <span>An ICD (internal communication device)</span>
        <span>An ATEC (augmentation and temporal enhancement chip)</span>
        <span> An AUD (accessible upload drive) </span>
        In addition to these, every citizen has a way of storing and paying with
        credits, more information on these technologies can be found in the
        economy section.
      </p>
      <h3>ICD</h3>
      <p>
        An ICD is a device implanted within the brain that allows individuals to
        connect socially and telepathically. This ranges from brief messages to
        people in your ‘contacts’ via voice, to the ability to transmit complex
        schematics or vivid imagery to a group of people within the same room.
        Individuals without an ICD can replicate some of the features using PCIs
        (personal communication interfaces, usually found within personal
        computers or other computational devices)
      </p>
      <h3>ATEC</h3>
      <p>
        Any individual with upgrades or implants must have an ATEC. This
        surgically-placed neurological implant modifies the functionality and
        capacity of the brain. Through use of an ATEC, an individual may gain
        access to abilities they previously did not have, or enhance those
        already present.
      </p>
      <h3>AUD</h3>
      <p>
        An AUD is a small interface, the port for which is placed on the neck,
        allows for entire libraries or databases of information to be given to
        the user instantly. That individual will then be able to recall anything
        from that information on demand, without delay. It should be noted that
        while the theory of something* can be imparted via AUD, practical
        application must still be practised and learned. (Yes, you can upload
        the knowledge of kung-fu to someone, but it won’t necessarily allow them
        to fight like Bruce Lee or Neo.)
