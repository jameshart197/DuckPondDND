      <h1 class="world-page-title">The History of Urxos</h1>
      <p>
        Before everything there was peace. The world lived happily, or as
        happily as any world does. There was racial diversity, and the world was
        a place of magic and beauty.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the time before ages, the inhabitants of this world lived in relative
        harmony. Companionship blossomed between the various races. Then came
        The Morgoth, the Original Evil, a Demon of great power. While other
        Obyrith (Evil Deities, see section 2C) were focussed purely on chaos and
        destruction, and were subsequently being removed from the Abyss by
        various other races, The Morgoth came to the material plane to escape
        destruction, but also because his nature was different. He planned, and
        he planned long term. Unlike other demons, he did not require wanton
        destruction, instead desiring domination. His efforts were calculated.
        Upon witnessing the arrival of The Morgoth, Ilvandel, God of Balance,
        created Shinshei, or Divinity, an immortal being on the material plane
        to balance The Morgoth. Thus ended the First Age.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first, neither Morgoth nor Shinshei affected the mortal plane
        directly, choosing instead to watch over from afar. Over time, The
        Morgoth began to gain an occult following in the bowels of the nether
        depths. As dwarves often will, they dug too deep, revealing The
        Morgoth’s presence to the races that inhabit the Underdark. Slowly the
        temptation of power that The Morgoth offered was enough to convert many
        to his following, and his power in this world grew. The Shinshei,
        however, recruited the kings of the goodly races. Soon a subtle war was
        taking place, followers being converted, and occasionally removed. Thus
        began the Third Age.
      </p>

      <p>
        As time passed, this developed into a complete split of Underworld and
        Overworld. But The Morgoth was a temptation too great to deny for many
        of the so-called Goodly races, in particular Gnomes and Humans. Many
        were drawn to the promise of power, and The Morgoth's influence started
        to reach the Overworld. To balance this, the Shinshei bestowed gifts of
        great power upon the goodly races; most of all the Elves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seeing this, The Morgoth allowed minor demons to come through the gates
        of the Abyss, a scourge upon the earth. So the Shinshei created Sylan, a
        land of pure paradise where his people would thrive. The Sylan was
        untouchable to The Morgoth, stretching halfway across the continent of
        Urxos. Over time, however, the corruption of The Morgoth spread across
        the boundaries. It was, in the end, not the Morgoth’s agents, but
        temptation that reduced Sylan to a dark corner of the world. Humans
        began to transform into something different, something darker. They
        discovered the process of Electrolosis, creating technology that used
        magic but was not magical in and of itself. As Electrolosis spread, so
        did the influence of The Morgoth. Apart from a few places of purity and
        justice, The Morgoth’s influence was now everywhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        So then began the Fourth Age. The age of technology. The age of balance.
        As The Morgoth had finally wiped out the majority of the Goodly Races
        from the earth, the Shinshei underwent a transition. Abandoning the
        purest of his morals, the Shinshei became involved in mortal politics,
        and in the use of Electrolosis. With this newfound power, the Shinshei
        was able to discreetly convert those of more flexible morals to keeping
        the goodly peace, and the two entered an agreement of peace, at least
        for now. But the balance is precarious. It may take only one domino tile
        to fall for the entire peace to collapse.
