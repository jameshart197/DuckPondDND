      <h1 class="world-page-title">Pantheons of Urxos</h1>
      <p>
        For as long as anyone remembers, the pantheon within Urxos is called The
        Seven. Seven Gods and Goddesses each with two facets, often representing
        a darker and lighter side, or some believe, a good and evil side. Each
        God or Goddess is represented by an image divided in half into the two
        Facets.
      </p>
      <p>
        In almost all cases both facets of all of The Seven are worshipped
        equally, though there are a few cases where superstition can cause a
        more quiet or respectfully distant form of worship. This is most common
        with Vileus, who is Father of Life and Death. His Death Aspect is often
        given a quiet nod, as opposed to fervent worship. Karazan's mischief
        aspect is often regarded as a God for criminals and thieves, though it
        doesn't stop children indulging in mischief during his festival times.
      </p>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Vileus</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <img

          alt="An image of Vileus"
          class="character-image"
        />
        <p>
          Vileus, often referred to as the Father, or the Facet of Life and
          Death, is depicted as both a kindly man and an almost unknowable,
          fearful power at the same time. There is much contrast between the
          Facet of Life, often worshipped by Druids, Clerics and the like for
          his mastery over healing, nature and growth, and his Facet of Death,
          often seen as a darker, more evil deity who Necromancers draw their
          power from.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vileus is revered throughout the year, but he is especially celebrated
          during the following festivals; The Day of the Seven, Rainsmeet, Day
          of Rebirth, The Long Goodbye, Festival of Life and the Harvest Gala.
          It might be noted that only The Long Goodbye is specifically dedicated
          to the Facet of Death.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Aever</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <img

          alt="An image of Aever"
          class="character-image"
        />
        <p>
          Aever, Bringer of Light and Shadow, is the God of Light and Darkness.
          One of the more distant and harder to comprehend Gods, Aever is much
          revered, but one of the least loved of all the Seven.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Facet of Light is often followed by Clerics of certain orders,
          Paladins, and many others seeking justice and truth. The Facet of
          Shadows is often followed by those seeking to hide the truth or hide
          in shadow, and few are the followers of the Aspect of Shadows who
          claim a truly Good Alignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aever is revered throughout the year, but he is especially celebrated
          during the following festivals; The Day of the Seven, Firefest and The
          Festival of Lights
        </p>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Amara</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">

          alt="An image of Amara"
          class="character-image"
        />
        <p>
          Amara, Mistress of Love and Lust, is probably the most beloved of the
          Seven. Both of her Facets are worshipped ardently and regularly, and
          she is often called upon during all manner of relationships, marriage
          and sexual interaction. Amara is seen as both a gentle and harsh
          mistress, but is followed by all but the coldest of hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amara is worshipped by various Cleric orders devoted to love, lust,
          fertility, marriage and beauty. She is also seen as the matron of most
          courtesans and her image is often painted upon bagnios and brothels
          worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amara is revered throughout the year, but she is especially celebrated
          during the following festivals; The Day of the Seven, Rainsmeet and
          Rapture, though many would argue she often sees more worship during
          festival days than the intended Aspect.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Zedin</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <img
          src="/assets/images/gods/zedin.png"
          alt="An image of Zedin"
          class="character-image"
        />
        <p>
          Zedin, Master of Arcana and Divinity, is often referred to as the
          Master of Magic. A deity of all magic, divine and arcane, he's often
          also attributed almost all other forms of magic as well, including the
          hedge magics, nature magics and various other arts. Zedin is seen as a
          fairly abstract God with little personality and much power. It is
          often said that to ask a bargain of Zedin is to trade that which you
          don't know for that which you didn't intend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zedin is worshipped by most wizards, and called upon by most Clerics
          of all Orders, though many Clerics have a second deity they revere.
          Zedin is also called upon by those who wish a miracle to change their
          circumstance, and his name is the one most often used as a curse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zedin is revered throughout the year, but he is especially celebrated
          during the following festivals; The Day of the Seven, Ginshu and
          Laishu.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Vela</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <img
          src="/assets/images/gods/vela.png"
          alt="An image of Vela"
          class="character-image"
        />
        <p>
          Vela, Lady of Fortune and Fate is a goddess whom almost all call upon
          in times of need, or when things don't seem to go their way. Often
          called Lady Luck, Vela is one of the most familiar and humanized of
          deities, and she's the favored Aspect by many.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vela is worshipped by gamblers, thieves, clerics and merchants alike,
          and in the ever-more materialistic cities of Anarkesia, it is not
          uncommon to see her image depicted on all manner of businesses,
          casinos and banks. Vela is often called upon in gambling houses and
          sporting events to bless one with luck,
        </p>
        <p>
          Vela is revered throughout the year, but she is especially celebrated
          during the following festivals; The Day of the Seven, Festival of
          Fortune and Swordsmeet, though she's often mentioned during Wintertide
          preparations as well.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Perceus</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <img
          src="/assets/images/gods/perceus.png"
          alt="An image of Perceus"
          class="character-image"
        />
        <p>
          Perceus, Lord of Peace and Passion, is often depicted with flame and
          water. Seen as the God of Emotions, it is not uncommon to hear Perceus
          blamed for one with a hot temper, or mentioned in reference when
          speaking of someone with unusual calm or inner peace. Whether called
          upon during meditation or sworn by during acts of violence, Perceus is
          a very humanized deity, despite his depiction being one of the least
          familiar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perceus is worshipped by orders of peace and tranquility and various
          meditative sects, and also by paladins of vengeance and war deities.
          Perceus is one of the Seven with the most contrast between his Facets,
          and worship of only one Facet is more common than with most other
          Gods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perceus is revered throughout the year, but he is especially
          celebrated during the following festivals; The Day of the Seven,
          Shinrah, Meadfest, Rapture, Firefest and Swordsmeet.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Karazan</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <img
          src="/assets/images/gods/karazan.png"
          alt="An image of Karazan"
          class="character-image"
        />
        <p>
          Karazan, Maestro of Music and Mischief, is favoured by many for his
          musical aspect, even though his Mischief aspect is most commonly
          ascribed to criminals and the like. The beloved God of Bards and
          Rogues alike, Karazan has been known to interfere directly with the
          mortal realm more than any of the other Seven, albeit in smaller
          manners. It is often believed that Karazan takes more interest in the
          activities of mortals than the other members of the Seven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Karazan is worshipped by orders of music and laughter and many
          different joyful churches. He is also followed diligently by many of
          the darker members of society and is often asked to forgive those who
          have transgressed against the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Karazan is revered throughout the year, but he is especially
          celebrated during the following festivals; The Day of the Seven,
          Rapture and the Festival of Dance, though there is usually music at
          most festivals, so one might argue he's always called upon during
          times of happiness and celebration.
