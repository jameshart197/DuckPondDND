      <h1 class="world-page-title">Magic in Urxos</h1>
      <p>
        Magic is very commonplace in Urxos, despite technology replicating a lot
        of its primary uses. Magic is still used for its convenience, simplicity
        and accessibility. However, whilst there is a lot of lower level magic,
        outside of the Mystix, there are not many high level practictioners of
        magic in Anarkesia, at least above the ground. In Perdition it may be
        more common to find very specifically talented magic users, such as
        Demons, Celestials, or practitioners of Necromancy or Divination.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of the upper city, whilst most citizens can lay claim to a
        cantrip or two, very few will be capable of casting anything above third
        level. And much magic has been replaced entirely by technology; almost
        nobody is capable of using spells such as Fly, Invisibility, Shield,
        Longstrider, or healing magic, as technology has replaced these arts
        completely.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also many magic users who specialize in things that enhance
        their day to day work. You may find entertainers incorporating illusions
        into their work for example, or various presenters making use of magic
        to enhance their style. There are others, such as journalists using
        magic to record information, chefs using a mage hand to hold a dish or
        business executives using illusions to demonstrate concepts who use
        magic as a by-product of their work without much thought.
      </p>
      <h2>Substantial Changes to Magic</h2>
      <p>
        There are many elements of magic that may be different in the world of
        Urxos, or in Anarkesia specifically. There are also laws, changes in
        logic and adjustments to certain spells. This information is documented
        below;
      </p>
      <h4>Truesight</h4>
      <p>
        It is worth noting that many humanoid individuals in Anarkesia will have
        implants giving them the ability to see through magical darkness or see
        individuals who are under the effects of invisibility. It is worth
        mentioning that this does <strong>not</strong> allow them to see through
        illusions.
      </p>
      <h4>Charm Person (and some similiar spells)</h4>
      <p>
        Most charm effects will not require a save from the enemy, but instead
        require a charisma check from you to disarm a person or cause them to
        cease their aggression. This may lead to the person being more civil
        towards you, speaking more freely, or even spilling secrets. People
        affected by this spell are not aware of it. Direct charms (or commands)
        still work as prior, but some humanoids may have implements assisting
        them in resisting these effects.
      </p>
      <h4>Summoning</h4>
      <p>
        Due to the prevalence of Demons, Devils and Celestials upon the material
        plane, “Summon” spells work very differently in Urxos. Instead of
        demanding that a being come forth, and it being completely under your
        control, you instead open a gate to another plane and make a request or
        interact with a creature. As a result of this the Mystix have banned the
        usage of all summons and inter-planar gates within cities, and breaking
        these rules can result in the eradication of magic from within your
        body. Nevertheless, summoners do exist and continue to thrive by making
        bonds with those that they summon.
      </p>
      <h4>Necromancy</h4>
      <p>
        In contrast, Necromancy is not illegal, though greatly frowned upon.
        This being the process of reanimating the dead, or causing a corpse to
        rise. Creatures who had cybernetic enhancements in life may retain them
        in death, and certain creatures reanimated may retain many of their
        abilities from life, and be more resistant to your control.
      </p>
      <h3>Changes to specific spells</h3>
      <p>The following spells have been removed</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Silvery Barbs</li>
        <li>Comprehend Languages</li>
        <li>Identify</li>
        <li>Tongues</li>
        <li>Contact other plane</li>
        <li>Distort Value</li>
        <li>Earthbind</li>
        <li>Thought Shield</li>
        <li>Protection from Ballistics</li>
        <li>Modify Memory</li>
        <li>Plane Shift and other Interplanar travel spells</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The following spells either have some change to their functionality, or
        there is something worth noting about their use or behaviour in
        Anarkesia. It is worth noting that many things are listed as illegal in
        cities. This means that if someone sees you casting them in Anarkesia
        (above ground) they may take exception. If that someone is a member of
        the Mystix, a government official or someone else in an official
        capacity they may enforce the law on you. Illegal often means you must
        be very careful how you use it, as opposed to
        <strong>you cannot</strong> use it.
      </p>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Detect Good and Evil</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Although this spell works as written, many, many citizens of the more
          technologically advanced cities will have implants that do not let
          their alignment, race, or other information about them be detected.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Detect Magic</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          This spell will reveal all Electrolosis as magic. When casting this
          spell, it will only reveal the presence of magic in general. An Arcana
          check (and perhaps others) will be needed to discern anything further.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">
        Detect Poison and Disease
      </button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Many poisons that use Electrolosis as opposed to magic or natural
          alchemy will not be detected by this spell.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Detect Thoughts</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The direct usage of this spell is far more complicated. You must first
          be touching the person whose thoughts you are trying to read, and
          secondly, if they have an implant preventing your reading their
          thoughts, you may attempt to bypass this but it might seriously injure
          the person in question. Casting Detect Thoughts for a general area
          will no longer give you thoughts, but instead the general emotions of
          the people surrounding you.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">
        Locate spells (Object, Creature, etc)
      </button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          Many protective barriers in place in cities and towns will render this
          spell useless.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Clairvoyance</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>This spell is illegal and fairly easily detectable in cities.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Arcane Eye</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>Illegal in most places in cities.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Telepathic Bond</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>Permanent if desired, will not work with implants preventing this connection.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Scrying</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>Works as intended, illegal in the underworld - many places will have detections in place either preventing this or getting you arrested.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Booming Blade/Green Flame Blade/Other spells enhancing attacks</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>Spells that affect attacks can be used on bullets, but not on guns, so will affect a single attack, not multiple. </p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Dispel Magic</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>This cannot dispel the magic inside Electrolosis devices, as the effect comes from a tiny diamond embedded within the device (and not visible by yourself)
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Fly</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>It is illegal to fly more than 15 feet above ground level in Anarkesia's cities. This does not apply to Perdition. A license is obtainable for people to fly above this height, but the procedure can be lengthy. This is mostly due to the prevalence of flying vehicles. It is worth noting that this is enforced a lot more strongly than most other laws within Anarkesia, and if you are seen flying above 15 feet without a license you may expect to lose your ability to fly for the foreseeable future.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Gaseous Form</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>Bullets cannot hit you in this form</p>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Banishment</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>Many creatures usually not native to the material plane may now be so (and thus will reappear after a minute)
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Dimension Door/Short range teleports</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>There are some blockades within cities placed in the ethereal plane preventing this spell from passing through them</p>
      </div>
      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Teleportation Circle</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>Requires a license to use</p>
