        <p>Cars in Anarkesia are exclusively self-driving, and automatically communicate and coordinate with other nearby 
        vehicles to negate the risk of collisions and accidents. Passengers simply give the details of the location they wish to go, 
        and the automated navigation systems select and optimize the route in real-time to eliminate traffic build-up within the city. 
        Most cars have an internal extra-dimensional space, allowing for a heightened, almost homely level of comfort. In some cases, 
        entire bars and office spaces can exist within their sleek and compact shell.</p>
        
        <p>These cars tend to have sophisticated security, utilizing AI-recognition systems so that only their designated passengers 
          can be transported. As an extra bonus, the cars are usually bullet-proof, and have powerful shock absorption systems. When 
          not in use, cars automatically transport themselves to large underground storage facilities, where robotic systems stack cars
           on rack-like shelves, resulting in one of the most compact car parks physically possible.</p>

            class="character-image"
          />
          <p>Helix vehicles are essentially cars, but instead of traveling across the ground on wheels, 
          they fly by means of four propulsion jets, one on each corner of the vehicle. These vehicles are 
          very slow, and so are considered impractical for transporting cargo or for traveling between cities
          and are only used for transportation within cities. They are also very expensive to use, and so for
          the most part only Helix Hires are used, which are effectively taxis that are paid by the journey. 
          Only the richest of businessmen and nobility are able to afford their own Helix Vehicles.</p>

            class="character-image"
          />
          <p>Hypertrons are the only vehicles in Anarkesia that are driven by people. They are twin-wheeled powered 
            vehicles, resembling futuristic motorcycles, known for their incredibly high speeds and acceleration, 
            with extremely tight handling and performance, and very few safety measures. They are by far the fastest 
            method of getting around the city without teleportation. Criminals tend to favor this method of transportation 
            over all others, as they are capable of off-road travel, are able to bypass many if not all of the traffic 
            management systems of the city, are easy to maneuver, and give the driver full autonomy and control. 
            They are also the only personal transport that can operate within Perdition.

          />
          <p>Landtrains are the primary means of transporting cargo between cities and countries. These heavily-armored 
            vehicles generate a strong electromagnetic field by passing charge through the outer plates of the vehicle. 
            This generated field is usually enough to ward off most hostile wildlife. For the more hardy and daring wildlife 
            that isnâ€™t repelled by this, touching the charged plate can give a particularly nasty shock that repels all but 
            the most determined and resilient creatures. Although not exclusive to Vega Transportation, a large proportion of
            the fleets are owned by them.

            class="character-image"
          />
          <p>There are four main train networks within Anarkesia. The first of these is the mainline rail network,
             connecting the districts and suburbs of Tethoris. It is a fairly luxurious and expensive form of transportation,
              operating at all times of day, primarily serving the more affluent members of society so they may travel
               from their mansions in the suburbs to their workplaces within the city, and back. </p>

          <p>The second train network is the Perdition subway, connecting the underground neighborhoods with each other. 
            A spider web of interconnecting train lines, somewhat resembling the New York subway or the London Underground of today,
             spans the entire region, providing cheap and fast transport to the populace. The fully-automated system is somewhat 
             neglected, with no amenities or services running parallel, and the trains and stations themselves are often 
             dirty and poorly maintained. </p>

          <p>
            The third train network is Intercity rail, connecting Lextor and Taxlington to Tethoris. These trains run twice an 
            hour from Tethoris to the other two cities and back, and contain fully functional restaurants, various entertainment
             areas and are extremely well kept. Utilizing speed and height as their primary defenses against the wilderness and 
             its inhabitants, these lines also have a small atmospheric field around them for the whole journey, excluding most 
             effects of weather and malignant ambient magic. Many workers commute from one city to another multiple times in a week, 
             and these lines have become the most convenient method of travel for most people.</p>

          <p>The fourth train network is the Tunnel Trains, which provide transport between all of the different countries within Urxos. 
            These lines are exclusively underground, even traveling under the sea, and are the safest method of transporting goods from 
            country to country, though they do also take passengers. It is less common for members of the general public to use Tunnel
            Trains than teleportation via the Mystix portals, but Tunnel Trains are a lot cheaper and more readily available to the 
            general populace. These trains can get quite hot and uncomfortable, and there are very few amenities on board beyond a basic 
            catering area. Tunnel Trains are known for their large robotic drivers who sometimes have to get out of the train to 
            clear obstacles from the line.</p>

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Monorail</button>

            alt="An image of a monorail"
            class="character-image"
          />
          <p>The light monorail system is the primary method of transport in Tethoris, and is used by the majority of the population 
            for commuting, leisure and everything in between. The carriages run on elevated tracks around 100 feet above the hustle 
            and bustle of the city and are always running- every hour of every day, never stopping even at stations. Carriages move 
            between stations at a moderate, relaxed pace, slowing to a crawl at stations so people may board and alight. The monorail 
            network was built and is currently maintained by Vega Transportation.</p>

            alt="An image of a teleportation circle"
            class="character-image"
          />
          <p>The Mystix Portals are a public teleportation system, operating primarily as a means of travel from one country to another, 
            though in some cases it is used to travel between different cities in the same country. The service is prohibitively expensive 
            and in high demand, often requiring bookings far in advance by all but the most important members of society. 
            Teleportation is also available within cities to various other areas of the city, but usually this service is reserved 
            for government officials, emergency services and the highest ranking members of nobility and celebrity. It should be noted 
            that use of Teleportation Circles must be registered with the Mystix and maintained according to their strict regulations.</p>
