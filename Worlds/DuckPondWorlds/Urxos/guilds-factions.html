      <h1 class="world-page-title">Guilds and Factions in Urxos</h1>
      <p>
        There are countless factions and guilds throughout the world of Urxos
        who hold power in their own ways. Some hold power only within the city
        they exist in and some spread their power throughout the entire world.
        These are some of the more well known factions that the party might
        already be aware of prior to the campaign start.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Mystix</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Mystix are a union of mages throughout the land of Urxos who
          answer only to themselves. Their primary goal is the furthering of
          magical studies and the control of Fiends, Celestials and Devils upon
          the lands of Urxos, however they are involved in many other
          activities. One such activity has recently become a priority, the
          control of Bastoose. This drug is especially dangerous to magic users
          and therefore the Mystix have done their best to shut down all
          channels to this drug. Beyond this the Mystix are also involved in
          architecture and building, resource management and fertilization,
          enabling of transport, travel and intercontinental communication and
          the restriction of Electrolosis technologies that are deemed a danger
          to international security.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Kandrosian Guard</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Kandrosian Guard are a group of knights of goodly weal. These
          knights are usually found wearing full armour, and carry a shield, a
          lance, and a rifle. This guard works directly for the Emperor of
          Kandros, although they are also spread across Urxos, doing his bidding
          and protecting those in need. It is difficult to estimate the numbers
          of the Kandrosian Guard, but at least a thousand are always stationed
          within Nekson itself. The guard is made up of a wide variety of races,
          and boasts a large number of magic users within its ranks. They tend
          to be honourable to a fault, and are always fiercely loyal to the
          Emperor. The most renowned of the Kandrosian Guard is the Lord
          Protector, Lord Ser Yenlav.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">The Collusion</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Collusion are a group formed within Anarkesia also known as “The
          Rebels”. This group believes in freedom above all else, and are
          regularly responsible for riots and revolts. Many who suffer dire
          poverty in Anarkesia turn to the Collusion for assistance. Operating
          both in the Overworld and Underworld of the cities of Anarkesia, this
          group has access to the best of Electrolosis technologies as well as
          many magic users within their ranks. Despite multiple attempts to wipe
          out this group, they are renowned for always rising stronger than
          before. The Collusion are also known for their forays into other
          countries to rescue those in need, who may be downtrodden by the
          politics of their lands.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Hellbringers</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Hellbringers are one of the most notorious criminal syndicate in
          Urxos. Although technically not agents of The Horresk they are
          incredibly careful to work around him. They tend to be involved in the
          traffic of narcotics and black market magic, various standard criminal
          activities such as thievery and assassination, and ensuring that
          everyone on the streets of major cities know that they are present and
          active. The Hellbringers wear a symbol of flame upon their right
          bicep, and are almost always carrying both weapon and sword.

      <button class="worldpage-accordion-button">Gao-Shai</button>
      <div class="worldpage-accordion-panel">
        <p>
          The Gao-Shai are the criminal syndicate of Damnation, the Underworld
          of Jurres. They are completely and utterly answerable to Gehenna and
          the Horresk, through The Lieutenant, who resides in the centre of
          Damnation. These criminals are organized and are usually found suited
          and booted wandering around Damnation in groups. They are not to be
          taken lightly however, and are more than happy to deliver street
          justice whenever necessary. Their symbol is a Dragon’s Head and they
          will usually have this both tattooed upon their body and upon a signet
          ring that they wear. Over recent years the Gao-Shai have extended
          their reach well beyond Jurres and into other countries, and have been
          seen in Perdition, Anarkesia's Criminal Underworld, though not in
          large numbers.
