        <p>
            Ingredients can be divided into those that can be grown or found and those that can be harvested
            from creatures. Listed below are the harvested ingredients that can be procured from animals, beasts and
            monsters.
            For a list of those that can be grown or found please see <a href="/homebrew/ingredients.html">Alchemical
                Ingredients</a>. Most alchemical ingredients have one primary purpose, but sometimes an ingredient can
            produce an unusual effect
            when mixed in a certain way. Not all properties are known for all alcemical ingredients, but details are
            given where
            possible.

                Animal Bones are a staple in any Alchemist's ingredient collection. They are often used for hardening to
                create
                oils, thickening when ground or for filtering recipes down. Whilst most animal bones have no innate
                properties of
                their own, they are a crucial part of the alchemical process.

                Animal Horns are another staple in the Alchemist's kitchen. They are often primarily used for focusing
                an ingredient into a specific part of the mixture, or for concentrating a solution Whilst most Animal
                Horns have
                no innate properties of their own, some can be incredibly powerful ingredients in their own right, so it
                is vital to check the properties of the horn you are using before including it in your potions.

            <p>
                Animal Skins are vast and varied, and most can be used in one way or another so it is not unusual to see
                an Alchemist carrying different bottled samples stored in vinegar. Animal Skins can have many different
                properties and are as varied as the animals they come from. That being said, almost any animal skin can
                be used as a bladder or container for an impact-based solution that is designed to shatter when thrown.
                Animal Skins can also be used to separate two parts of a concoction until impact. There are also various
                poisons that are filtered through animal skins to remove taste or texture from a liquid without losing
                potency.

                Animal Teeth are a staple of the Alchemist's Kit. They are the best of funnels when a small hole is
                bored into the tip, and can be used for reducing and distilling. It can also be a great way of filtering
                out the thicker parts or solids from a liquid. Animal teeth can often have magical properties of their
                own when they belong to mightier beasts, included sharpening, cleansing and cutting.

                The Eyeball of an Animal can be used for a number of different things. Whilst some are completely
                useless, the majority of them hold some small amount of magic that allows them to be used in the
                processes of divination. Whether in scrying, observing or casting auguries, the eyeballs of animals have
                been used in the process for centuries. Some eyes have individual properties however, so it is always
                worth checking this before using them in your distillations. It might be noted that some darker poisons
                create hallucinations and visions, and those draughts often contain eyeballs.

                harvested or they quickly fade and lose their power.

                A staple basic in the poisoner's inventory, the pain that accompanies poisoning by a scorpion is most
                exquisite. It can be combined with other ingredients to cause unusual and interesting effects, but its
                primary purpose is simply pain. Milking a scorpion is a task best done by those most experienced and
                careful though.

                Snake's Tongues are well known for their uses in spellcasting as a component. What is little known is
                that depending on the breed of snake, the tongue of a snake can be used to alter poisons and the time
                they require to take effect. There are also some recipes that call for a snake's tongue that call on the
                power of thunder storms, though these are incredibly difficult to prepare.

                magical properties within the heart of a Unicorn, is yet to be verified.
