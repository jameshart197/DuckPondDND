            Ingredients can be divided into those that can be grown or found and those that can be harvested
            from creatures. Listed below are those alcemical ingredients that can be grown or found. For a list
            of those that can be harvested please see <a href="/homebrew/harvestables.html">Harvested Ingredients</a>. Most
            alchemical ingredients have one primary purpose,
            but sometimes an ingredient can produce an unusual effect when mixed in a certain way. Not all properties
            are known for all alcemical ingredients, but details are given where possible.

                This large mushroom is often found growing in clusters near bodies of water, or around other damp
                terrain. It has a bold blue stem accompanied by a large red cap, which makes this fungi extremely easy
                to identify. Professional herbalists often cut the head from the root, as the mushroom has the rare
                ability to re-grow its cap within a few short weeks.

                root is bitter and acidic. The weed is one of an assassin’s favorite plants, due to the root’s ability
                to freeze a creature’s bloodstream, which leads to a slow and agonizing death. The Arctic Creeper is
                toxic to many unwary travelers, as it is quite easy to consume the root’s toxins while enjoying the
                sweet flavorsome leaves.

                This unusually elongated plant can stand up to four feet tall, and is very easy to spot due to its
                distinctive white and brown speckled pattern. The Arrow Root thrives in desert and drought environments,
                as the plant needs very little water to survive. When diced and boiled in water the plant creates a
                frothy silver liquid, which is ideal for sharpening and polishing weapons and armor without the use of
                magic or other means.

                occupies almost no space in their packs.

                Another common mushroom is this dark blue cap with a yellow striped stem. When disturbed, this mushroom
                lets off a puff of blue powder. Usually this causes no permanent harm to the surrounding creatures, but
                it can stain their skin and equipment for a short while. The powder is commonly used to color various
                inks and dyes. Herbalists usually search for the fungi around small watering holes, where aquatic life
                often thrives.

                This usually clear liquid can be found within most cacti around the world. It’s reasonably difficult to
                extract, as many cacti are dangerous to work with. Brewers love to use this juice in many recipes, as
                one of its effects is to delay alcohol intoxication, allowing people to purchase and consume more before
                it hits them. Its lesser known properties include the ability to induce weightlessness.

                Adventurers that are adept in the use of Fennel Silk will recognize the many applications it has
                for protecting your extremities from harsh-low temperature environments.

                These long, red thorn-encrusted vines can stretch up to 3 feet long and have sharp thorns that reach up
                to an inch or two long. It isn’t rare to find blood stains amongst these vines as many animals and
                adventurers can easily trip or get caught in a bushel of the vines. The vines also seem to have a
                sentient quality to them as they relax when prey is near, and contract when captured.

                This extremely hardened dark green vine can be found growing in the ground near very old minerals, often
                seeming to feed off the minerals themselves. At first glance this vine seems completely useless to
                mortals, but arcane studies have shown this vine to harden a person’s skin significantly if combined
                with a powerful catalyst.

                These light brown beans can occasionally be found hanging from Scillia Bushes in dry atmosphere

                effect. At full potency, some of these beans can offer the user the ability to climb steep cliffs and
                rock faces with ease.

                This silver-grey plant looks as though it represents madness itself. It often has random patterns and
                unplanned shapes, but always has a black web-like pattern on it. Although it may look deadly to touch,
                when prepared properly a Herbalist can unleash a torrent of elemental power representing a breath
                weapon.

                Often found hanging amongst the bone like flowers, this white berry can be harvested and crushed to
                enhance toxins made by scoundrels. However, this effect only applies when introduced directly to the
                bloodstream. When ingested normally these berries provide little sustenance, but do not harm the person.

                very careful when they extract this root from the ground, as it seems to defy gravity and want to “fly”
                away.

                This incredibly rare fungi has become something of a fable amongst herbalists. It is reported to have a
                large bulbous cap growing atop a thin stem, and to normally form in small clusters deep within damp cave
                environments and forests. The organism is usually a translucent blue, and is rumored to render creatures
                invisible once consumed.

                These huge white bulbs can be found on small yellow mushrooms often found in swamps or wet caverns. The
                mushroom releases a puff of powder from these bulbs when threatened and it tends to confuse and hinder a
                person. When harvested successfully, these bulbs can be ground into a paste and imbibed within magical
                water to diminish the size of a being.
