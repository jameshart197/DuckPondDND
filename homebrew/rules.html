      <h1 class="world-page-title">Homebrew Rules</h1>
      <p>
        There are a variety of different homebrew rules we use during Duck Pond
        games. These are intended to increase the fun of the game, the ease of
        understanding and occasionally the difficulty.
      </p>
      <ul id="rules-list">
        <li>
          Potions are a bonus action to use. Healing potions may be used as an
          action if you wish to gain the full amount of healing possible as
          opposed to rolling. You may also use your action to give someone else
          a potion, if conscious they must use their reaction to drink it.
        </li>
        <li>
          A natural 20 on initiative will grant you advantage on your first
          action.
        </li>
        <li>
          Haste grants a second “action of attacks” - if your character has 2
          attacks as base, hasted they will have 4
        </li>
        <li>
          Flanking is melee only. When 2 or more creatures that are not
          incapacitated surround an enemy they will have +2 to hit that
          creature.
        </li>
        <li>You cannot hide in plain sight. Ever</li>
        <li>
          Summons/pets/additionals always go immediately after their “owner”
        </li>
        <li>
          Dice can be rolled on d&d beyond or in real life but please roll
          initiative on DNDBeyond
        </li>
        <li>
          Tasha’s Optionals apply in all situations the player wishes them to
          (racials, class options etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover grants armor class (2 for quarter, 4 for half, 6 for three
          quarter, 10 for full)
        </li>
        <li>
          Hit points may be manually rolled - 1s are rerolled, 2s are rerolled
          for d10/12 hit die classes
        </li>
        <li>Help requires proficiency OR a good explanation</li>
        <li>
          Drawing/sheathing a weapon is a free action *almost* all the time (you
          may not draw and sheath the same weapon in a single turn as a free
          action)
        </li>
        <li>
          Characters gain feats as they level (2,6,10,14,18) and must take stats
          when granted ASIs by standard rules
        </li>
        <li>
          You may learn a proficiency. This takes time, and can take longer
          based on the proficiency in question and your current abilities (a
          high intelligence character might learn a language swiftly, but a low
          strength and constitution character may take a long time to adjust to
          wearing heavy armor)
        </li>
        <li>
          When taking a feat, I would greatly prefer it if you take something
          that makes sense with your character in roleplay, as opposed to the
          strongest option. I also reserve the right to reject feat choices.
        </li>
        <li>
          We will be using XP levelling, and XP can (and will) be granted for
          roleplay activities, combat victories, discoveries, general progress
          as characters, story progress or certain milestone achievements. All
          characters will always have the same amount of XP. Non-Combat
          solutions will often grant more XP but less loot!
        </li>
        <li>
          Most important/valuable/strong magical items will use the
          Dormant/Slumbering/Awakened/Exalted progression system, allowing you
          to find cool items and then have them progress with you. Other magical
          items found will mostly be limited/single use items.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any character can use a scroll. It requires an Arcana check (with your
          spellcasting stat in place of Intelligence if you are a spellcaster)
          to use a scroll, DC = 10 + spell level
        </li>
        <li>
          Acrobatics can be used in place of Athletics to contest a grapple or
          escape, but not to initiate one (unless your class states otherwise)
        </li>
        <li>
          In general, some skills may use alternate attributes where appropriate
          (Intimidation using Strength for example)
        </li>
        <li>
          A surprise round is limited to a single action by a single player
          (this applies to enemies too!)
        </li>
        <li>
          Inspiration Cards are going to be in use, and I will be giving them
          out during the game and sometimes at the end. These can be: Reroll
          with Advantage, add a D4/6/8 or Automatically Succeed. I would prefer
          players to avoid using more than one inspiration card in a single
          combat!
        </li>
        <li>Please don’t draw on the map/images! It really does upset me!</li>
        <li>
          Two people may exchange initiatives prior to combat. This is not
          usable on natural 1s or natural 20s and is only doable by a maximum of
          two people once per combat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Failing three death saves (dying) allows for a “last hurrah” moment.
          This is an action that may be taken immediately but cannot be used to
          attempt to save one’s own life.
        </li>
        <li>
          Jumping is a free action requiring half your movement speed, or a
          bonus action, players choice.
        </li>
        <li>
          A melee character may choose to use a cleave attack, making attack
          rolls against all creatures in range. They may then split their damage
          evenly between the number of enemies hit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Retreat is now an action, giving a combined Dash and Dodge effect, but
          only when moving directly away from opponents.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lucky requires a reaction to change an opponent's roll, and is limited
          to once per turn for changing one's own rolls.
        </li>
        <li>
          Having a “language” doesn’t necessarily mean you are fluent in it. But
          it might mean you know things about that culture, those people, or can
          understand historical references.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bonus actions can be used in place of your action. This does not allow
          for two spell casts in one turn.
        </li>
        <li>Dangerous criticals will be in play</li>
        <li>
          Dropping to 0 hit points grants a level of exhaustion (after the
          combat) - this effect stacks.
        </li>
        <li>
          A failed skill check can be repeated at the cost of a level of
          exhaustion. This roll is a single roll of the die, and does not
          include any disadvantage/advantage on the initial roll.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may use your opportunity attack to grapple a creature instead of
          attack
        </li>
        <li>
          Changed Exhaustion Rules: Each level of exhaustion grants a -1 to all
          d20 rolls, and the DC of your abilities/spell saves. At 5 levels of
          exhaustion, characters cannot take the dash action and short rests
          take 2 hours. If you exceed 10 levels of exhaustion (reach level 11)
          you die.
        </li>
        <li>
          Natural 20s on saving throws and ability checks are always a success,
          though with ability checks it may grant a success in a different
          manner than expected.
        </li>
        <li>
          A player may take two levels of exhaustion to cast a spell they have
          prepared if they have no remaining spell slots.
        </li>
        <li>Deaths saves are made in private to the DM</li>
      </ul>
